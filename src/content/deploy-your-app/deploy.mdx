For this tutorial, you will be using a variation of our Movies app, but removing all the Okteto specific configuration first.

Start by cloning the Movies app repo:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-onboard
$ cd movies-onboard
```

> The branch `onboarded` of the https://github.com/okteto/movies-onboard repo contains all the changes you will be doing through this tutorial. It can be useful to visualize all the changes you will do once you finish this tutorial.

The Movies app comes with a Helm chart to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
To instruct Okteto to deploy the Movies app, create an `okteto.yaml` file at the root of the repo with the following content:

```yaml
deploy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - name: Helm Install
      command: helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

> Using [remote: true](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy-remotely) instructs Okteto to run the commands in the cluster.

Before deploying the Movies app, let's start by cleaning your namespace with the following command:

```console
$ okteto destroy -v --all
```

```console
Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
...
All resources successfully destroyed
```

This is important to make sure there is no orphaned resources from previous samples.

Now deploy the Movies app by running the following command:

```console
$ okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindylopez @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindylopez
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  There are no available endpoints for 'movies-onboard'.
    Follow this link to know more about how to create public endpoints for your application:
    https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/ingress/automatic-ssl
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies-onboard' successfully deployed
```

Check that the Movies app is up un running by login into the Okteto UI:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/movies-onboard-deploy-ui.png").default}
  alt="Movies Onboard Deploy"
  width="850"
/>

Or by configuring your Kubernetes credentials to access your Okteto Namespace:

```console
$ okteto kubeconfig
```

```
Updated kubernetes context 'okteto_example_com/cindylopez' in '[/Users/cindylopez/.kube/config]'
```

And using `kubectl` to visualize your Okteto Namespace:

```console
$ kubectl get all
```

```

## Next Steps

Awesome, you have deployed the Movies app to Okteto ðŸš€

But the Okteto CLI is informing that `There are no available endpoints for 'movies-onboard'`...

Let's fix that in the [next step](deploy-your-app/endpoints.mdx) of this guide!
