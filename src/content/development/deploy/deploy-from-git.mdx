## Prerequisites

Please make sure to configure your Git repositories with the [appropriate manifests](core/okteto-manifest.mdx) before using them to deploy Dev Environments.

## Deploy

Log in to your Okteto instance (e.g. `https://okteto.example.com`), and click on the **Deploy Dev Environment** button on the top left.
A dialog will open asking for a Git repository to deploy. Make sure that "**Git URL**" is selected as the source.
Type the URL for the Movies App repo (https://github.com/okteto/movies), pick a branch, and click **Deploy**:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/deploy-git-v1.17+.png").default}
    alt="deploy from git"
    width="650"
  />
</p>

When you deploy a dev environment using a Git repository, Okteto will analyze your repo and automatically deploy it running `okteto deploy --build`.
In the example above, Okteto will install a Helm chart with the Movies App demo.

:::tip

Check the [Okteto Manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx) to learn more about how to configure your development environment deployment with an `okteto.yaml` file.

:::

As soon as your development environment is deployed, you'll see its state in the UI. The UI will be automatically updated as the different components are created.
Your development environment will be ready to go once it reaches the `Success` state.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/ui-movies-git+1.32.png").default}
    alt="UI of the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Redeploy

Click the **Redeploy** button on the right of your development environment.

A dialog will open where you can modify the branch to redeploy and configure advanced options:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/redeploy-git-v1.17+.png").default}
    alt="Redeploy from git with dependencies"
    width="600"
  />
</p>

If your application has declared dependencies, you'll see a checkbox to **Include all direct dependencies**. When selected, Okteto will also redeploy the services listed as direct dependencies of your development environment.

Click **Redeploy** and your environment will be updated with the latest source code and configuration.

## Destroy

You can also destroy your development environment with a single click.

Go back to the extended menu of your development environment and click the **Destroy** button.
A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click on **Destroy** and your development environment and all of the resources created for it will be gone:

If your application has dependencies, you’ll also see an option to destroy its direct dependencies. This ensures all related services are cleaned up together, helping to prevent orphaned resources.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/destroy-git.png").default}
    alt="Destroy application"
    width="450"
  />
</p>

You won't be able to recover resources after the development environment has been destroyed, so back up any sensitive data before running this action.

## Variables

When you deploy from Git, you can add Variables that will be available as environment variables during the deployment of your development environment.

## Adding a Develop on Okteto Button

The **Develop on Okteto** button is a shortcut to deploy your development environments with a single click.

The button is designed to be used in GitHub README files, documentation sites, or pretty much anywhere that renders an HTML file.
Use this instead of writing a never-ending list of manual steps on how to deploy your development environments.

Here's an example button that shows you how to deploy [the Movies App](https://github.com/okteto/movies) on an Okteto instance:

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://okteto.example.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies)

### Adding the Develop on Okteto button

There are two ways of referencing the source code repository:

- Resolve it implicitly. This is useful in GitHub `README.` files. If you don't specify the repository, Okteto will infer it using the `referrer` header. This only works on public repositories hosted in https://github.com.
- Using the `repository` and `branch` parameters. This is useful for buttons hosted outside of https://github.com, in blog posts, or documentation.

#### Using an implicit repository

If you're embedding the button in a public GitHub repository's `README` file, Okteto will automatically infer the repository and the branch using the referrer header when someone clicks on the button.

Here's an example:

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://okteto.example.com/deploy)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a href="https://okteto.example.com/deploy">
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto" />
</a>
```

A `develop-okteto.png` is also available.

#### Adding explicit parameters

Use the following Markdown snippet as a template, changing the `repository` and `branch` query parameters to match your repository. The `branch` query parameter is optional.

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://okteto.example.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a
  href="https://okteto.example.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main"
>
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto" />
</a>
```

### Parameters

You can parametrize your development environment deployment using the following parameters:

- `repository`: The repository to be deployed. If it's not present, Okteto will automatically infer it using the referrer header, if available.
- `branch`: The repository branch to be deployed. If not included, it will use the default branch of the repository.
- `vars`: It allows you to specify a list of variables that will be available as environment variables during the deployment. It is optional. .e.g `vars=[{"name":"THEME","value":"dark"},{"name":"LANG","value":"en"}]`. This would generate 2 environment variables avaible on your deployment: `THEME=dark` and `LANG=en`. It has to be URL encoded.
- `filename`: The location of the [Okteto Manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx) relative to the root of the repository.
