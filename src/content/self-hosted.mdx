Okteto is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of the [Okteto Development Platform](index.md), with the control and flexibility of running in your Kubernetes infrastructure.

With Okteto your team can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) or from your [Git Repositories](deploy/deploy-from-git.mdx).
- Configure [Secrets](manifest/okteto-secrets.mdx) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx) for your services, [Private Endpoints](core/ingress/private-endpoints.mdx) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](cloud/custom-domains.mdx).
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](core/components/build-service.mdx).
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](core/components/container-registry.mdx).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](core/components/namespaces.mdx) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](core/credentials/kubernetes-credentials.mdx) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Collaborate by [sharing](core/components/namespaces.mdx#share-your-namespace) your namespaces with your teammates
- Keep your infrastructure under control with the Okteto [Garbage Collector](administration/cleanup.mdx) and the [Okteto Autoscaler](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#autoscaler)
