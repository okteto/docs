# Launch Development Environments from your Catalog  <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

The Catalog enables `admins` to provide you and your team with a list of pre-configured repositories directly in the Okteto web UI. With Catalog, you no longer need to worry about using the right Okteto manifest, setting up the right branch or configuring the necessary environment variables. You pick the repository, click Deploy, and everything is automatically deployed in seconds.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator needs to enable this feature and add at least one item to the catalog for this option to be available to you. More information on this [is available here](administration/catalog.mdx).

## Launch a Development Environment from your Catalog

In order to deploy a development environment using the Catalog navigate to `Namespaces` → `Launch Dev Environment` → `Catalog`.

In this tab you should see all of the repositories that your team has added (and pre-configured). Select an entry you wish to use and click `Launch`.

When you launch a dev environment using the Catalog, Okteto  will automatically deploy the repository, manifest path, and variables defined by your team. This is the equivalent of running `okteto deploy --build --path $PATH.yaml --variables=XXXXX` from your command line.

In the example above, Okteto will deploy the "Scheduling Application", from the "main" branch, and passing the "SCHEDULE_URL", "SLACK_CHANNEL", and "ANOTHER_VAR" variables.

> Check the [Okteto Manifest](reference/manifest.mdx) to learn more about how to configure your development environment deployment with an `okteto.yml` file.

As soon as your development environment is deployed, you'll see its state in the UI. The UI will be automatically updated as the different components are created.
Your development environment will be ready to go once it reaches the `Success` state.

## Customize your Development Environment

Before clicking the `Launch` button, you are able to modify any of the values of your Development Environment. Use this if you want to launch a different branch, or set different values for the preconfigured variables, or use a different Okteto manifest. 

## Redeploy your Development Environment

Click the **Redeploy** button on the right of your development environment.

A dialog will open where you can modify the branch, variables, and path to the Okteto manifest used to deploy your Development Environment:

Click **Relaunch** and your development environment will be updated with the source code of the given branch.

## Destroy

You can also destroy your development environment with a single click.

Go back to the extended menu of your development environment and click the **Destroy** button.
A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click on **Destroy** and your development environment and all of the resources created for it will be gone:

You won't be able to recover resources after the development environment has been destroyed, so back up any sensitive data before running this action.
