Download your Kubernetes credentials and start developing your applications in Okteto  with your favorite CLI tools.
There are two different ways of downloading your Kubernetes credentials:

- Download your Kubernetes credentials [using the Okteto CLI](#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-using-the-okteto-cli).

- Download your Kubernetes credentials [from the Okteto dashboard](#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-from-the-okteto-cloud-ui).

## Download your Kubernetes credentials using the Okteto CLI

If this is your first time using the Okteto CLI, install it following [this guide](cloud/okteto-cli.mdx).

The Okteto CLI can download your Kubernetes credentials from Okteto. To do this, run the `okteto context` command:

```console
$ okteto context use https://okteto.example.com
```

```console
Authentication will continue in your default browser
 âœ“  Context 'okteto.example.com' created
```

If you're not logged into Okteto yet, it will also run the login sequence.

Once your okteto context is configured to access Okteto, run the following command:

```console
$ okteto kubeconfig
```

```console
Updated kubernetes context 'example_okteto_com/cindylopez' in '/Users/cindylopez/.kube/config'
```

The `okteto kubeconfig` command adds your Kubernetes credentials to your kubeconfig file, and sets it as the current Kubernetes context.
Once you do this, you'll have full access to your Kubernetes namespace with `kubectl`, `helm` or any other CLI tool.

## Download your Kubernetes credentials from the Okteto dashboard

From the Okteto dashboard you should also find your credentials in the `Settings > Setup` section.

Once downloaded, point your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the credentials file:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac-linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'MacOS / Linux', value: 'mac-linux', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="mac-linux">

```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/Downloads/okteto-kube.config:${KUBECONFIG:-$HOME/.kube/config}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```console
> $Env:KUBECONFIG=("$HOME\Downloads\okteto-kube.config;$Env:KUBECONFIG;$HOME\.kube\config")
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

To see that the new configuration is working, enter this command:

```console
$ kubectl get all
```
```console
No resources found.
```

## Using your Kubernetes credentials

Before using your Kubernetes credentials, it is important to know that the kubeconfig file generated by Okteto uses a [credential plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) to authenticate you via Okteto to access your Kubernetes cluster. It is a common pattern used by many Kubernetes providers, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to connect to Kubernetes clusters in a more secure way. For this reason, it is important that the Okteto CLI is in your PATH and connected to your Okteto instance (having executed `okteto context use ...`).

Once you've downloaded your credentials and it is configured, you'll have full access to your Kubernetes namespaces on Okteto directly from your terminal, using the tools you're already familiar with, such as `helm`, `kubectl`, `okteto` or `skaffold`.

For example, you could use `kubectl` to deploy our `hello-world` application:

```terminal
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okteto/go-getting-started/master/k8s.yml
```

> As mentioned before, credential plugins are a way of managing Kubernetes cluster credentials in a more secure way as you get time-bound tokens for your service account instead of using auto-generated secret-based ones. In case you face any issue with Okteto's credential plugin or you just want to keep using static auto-generated tokens, you can do it by setting the environment variable `OKTETO_USE_STATIC_KUBETOKEN` to `true` before running any Okteto command. Be aware that using those static tokens is not recommended by Kubernetes, and you will start getting warnings in your `kubectl` output from version `1.27` encouraging you to stop using them.
