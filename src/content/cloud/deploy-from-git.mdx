<!-- This document covers how to deploy a development environment for a given Git repository.
Note that your Git repository needs to be configured with an [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/).
Read the Okteto Pipeline [getting started guide](/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-pipelines/) to learn how to create an Okteto Pipeline for your Git repository. -->

## Prerequisites
When you deploy a Git repository, Okteto Cloud will analyze the source code of your Git repository, looking for clues on how to deploy your application.

Okteto will look for deployment manifests in the following order:

1. [Okteto Manifest v2](/docs/reference/manifest/) file: if your repository has an `okteto.yml` or `.okteto/okteto.yml` with a deploy section, Okteto will detect it and run the commands from the `deploy` section.
1. [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/): if your repository has a `chart`, `charts`, `helm/chart`, or `helm/charts` directory with a `Chart.yaml` file in it, Okteto will detect the chart and run `helm upgrade --install` on it.
1. [Okteto Stacks](/docs/reference/stacks/) file: if your repository has a `okteto-stack.yaml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto stack deploy --build` on this file.
1. [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file: if your repository has a `docker-compose.yaml`, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto stack deploy --build` on this file.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) folder: if your repository has a `manifests`, `kubernetes`, or `k8s` folder, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` on the folder.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) file: if your repository has a `manifests.yaml`, `kubernetes.yaml`, or `k8s.yaml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` on the manifest file.
1. [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest/) file: if your repository has an `okteto.yml` or `.okteto/okteto.yml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto push` on the manifest file.

If Okteto is not able to detect how to deploy your application, or you want to have more control over it, you can setup an [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) by adding a `okteto-pipeline.yml` or `.okteto/okteto-pipeline.yml` file to the root of your repository.

## Deploy

Log in to [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com), and click on the **Deploy** button on the top left.
A dialog will open asking for a Git repository to deploy. Make sure that "**Git URL**" is selected as the source.
Type the URL for the Movies App repo (https://github.com/okteto/movies), pick a branch, and click **Deploy**:

When you deploy a Git repository, Okteto Cloud will analyze your repo and automatically deploy it.
In the example above, Okteto will install the chart of the Movies App with Helm.

> Check the [Configuration section](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) to learn more about Okteto's auto deployment capabilities, and how to customize this with a `okteto-pipeline.yml` file.

As soon as your application is deployed, you'll see its state in the UI. The UI will be automatically updated as the different components are created. Your application will be ready to go once it reaches the `Success` state.

## Redeploy

Click the **Redeploy** button on the right of your application.

A dialog will open where you can modify the branch to redeploy:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/redeploy-git.png" alt="Redeploy in git" width="600" /></p>

Click **Deploy** and your applications will be updated with the source code of the given branch. This action will follow the same [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) as the [Deploy](#Deploy) action.

## Destroy

You can also destroy your application with a single click.

Go back to the extended menu of your application and click the **Destroy** button.
A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click on **Destroy** and your application and all of the resources created for it will be gone:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/destroy-git.png" alt="Destroy application" width="450" /></p>

You won't be able to recover resources after the application has been destroyed, so back up any sensitive data before running this action.

## Variables

When you deploy from Git, you can add Variables that will be available as environment variables during the execution of the pipeline.

## Adding a Develop on Okteto Button

The **Develop on Okteto** button is a shortcut to deploy your development environments with a single click.

The button is designed to be used in GitHub README files, documentation sites, or pretty much anywhere that renders an HTML file.
Use this instead of writing a never-ending list of manual steps on how to deploy your development environments.

Here's an example button that deploys [the Movies App](https://github.com/okteto/movies) on Okteto Cloud.

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies)

The only requirements for creating the button are that your application be deployed in Okteto Cloud, and that the application's source code is hosted in a public Git repository.

### Adding the Develop on Okteto button

There are two ways of referencing the source code repository:
- Resolve it implicitly. This is useful in GitHub `README.` files. If you don't specify the repository, Okteto will infer it using the `referer` header. This only works on public repositories hosted in https://github.com.
- Using the `repository` and `branch` parameters. This is useful for buttons hosted outside of https://github.com, in blog posts, or documentation.

#### Using an implicit repository

If you're embedding the button in a public GitHub repository's `README` file, Okteto will automatically infer the repository and the branch using the referer header when someone clicks on the button.

Here's an example:

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a href="https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy">
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto">
</a>
```

A `develop-okteto.png` is also available.

#### Adding explicit parameters

Use the following Markdown snippet as a template, changing the `repository` and `branch` query parameters to match your repository. The `branch` query parameter is optional.

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a href="https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main">
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto">
</a>
```

### Parameters

You can parametrize your deployment using the following parameters:

- `repository`: The repository to be deployed.  If it's not present, Okteto will automatically infer it using the referer header, if available.
- `branch`: The repository branch to be deployed. If not included, it will use the default branch of the repository.
- `vars`: It allows you to specify a list of variables that will be available as environment variables during the deployment. It is optional. .e.g `vars=[{"name":"THEME","value":"dark"},{"name":"LANG","value":"en"}]`. This would generate 2 environment variables avaible on your deployment: `THEME=dark` and `LANG=en`. It has to be URL encoded.
- `filename`: The location of  the [Okteto pipeline file](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/#customize-the-okteto-pipeline) relative to the root of the repository. If not included, it will default to `okteto-pipeline.yaml`.
