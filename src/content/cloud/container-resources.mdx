Okteto leverages the concept of [Kubernetes resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) to decide on which node to place each container.

When you specify a resource `limit` for a container, Okteto enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set.
Okteto also reserves at least the `request` amount of that system's resources specifically for that container to use.

## Best Practices

It's strongly recommended that you configure your CPU and Memory `requests` to align with your container's actual resource utilization.
By doing so, you ensure that your containers always have sufficient resources available for optimal development speed.

## Resource Consumption

The Okteto UI shows information about the memory and CPU that deployments and statefulsets are using:

## Access your Metrics with kubectl

If you require more detailed data on your container resource consumption, you can use the `kubectl top pods` command.

Fetch your kubectl credentials with `okteto kubeconfig` and run `kubectl top pods` to access your container's metrics:

```console
$ kubectl top pod
```

```
NAME                        CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
api-7cc77bcdcb-pm72j        89m          66Mi
frontend-78b8b698cf-5wb5p   1m           2Mi
mongodb-0                   5m           160Mi
```

## Configure your Development Environment Resources

There are three different ways to configure the container resources for your development environments:

- [Kubernetes manifest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
- [Docker Compose](/reference/compose/#resources-object-optional)
- [Okteto Manifest](/reference/manifest/#resources-object-optional)

As an admin, you can also define the [quotas and default resources](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#quotas) for all your containers.
