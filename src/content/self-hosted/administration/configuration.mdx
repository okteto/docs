## General Settings

### cluster

- `endpoint`: The public endpoint of your Kubernetes cluster. It will be used by Okteto when generating `Kubeconfig` credentials for your users.

```yaml
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://52.30.32.1"
```

### license

You'll receive a license key as part of your subscription to Okteto. If you haven't received it, [please open a support ticket](https://okteto.com/support).

If you are interested in evaluating Okteto, [sign up for our free 30 days trial, no credit card required](https://www.okteto.com/free-trial/).

```yaml
license: XXXXX
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#cloud-provider-secret) to store the license.

### subdomain

Okteto's [automatic SSL endpoints](cloud/ssl.mdx) allows you to expose secure and unique public endpoints for your development environments. By default, all endpoints created by Okteto will use a combination of the name of the app, the namespace, and the `subdomain`.
For example, if you have a development environment named `app` in the `cindy` namespace, it will be accessible at https://app-cindy.example.com if `subdomain` is example.com.

```yaml
subdomain: "example.com"
```

Okteto's frontend and API services will be also accessible via https://okteto.$SUBDOMAIN.
Once Okteto is installed, you can use `kubectl` to retrieve the public address of the Okteto NGINX Ingress Controller:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    34.68.230.234   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address to create a DNS entry for `*.$SUBDOMAIN`.

You can overwrite Okteto's public URL using the [publicOverride](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#publicoverride) field.

### publicOverride

Use this property to override the Public URL where Okteto is available. This option replaces `okteto.$SUBDOMAIN` with your [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) of choice.

```yaml
publicOverride: "example.com"
```

**Important**: When using `publicOverride`, the certificate referred by [wildcardCertificate.name](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#wildcardcertificate) must be valid for `publicOverride`, `registry.$SUBDOMAIN` and `buildkit.$SUBDOMAIN`.

When `publicOverride` is set, an additional component is deployed for [Okteto Private Endpoints](cloud/private-endpoints.mdx) feature.
You can configure its settings using the [privateEndpoints](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#privateEndpoints) section.

When setting your [auth provider](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#auth), the authentication callback URL and origin URL will change to the following:

**Callback URL**:
```
https://${publicOverride}/auth/callback
https://private-endpoints.${subdomain}/auth/callback
```

**Origin URL**:
```
https://${publicOverride}
https://private-endpoints.${subdomain}
```

### auth

Okteto supports the following authentication methods:

- [Bitbucket](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#bitbucket)
- [GitHub](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#github)
- [Google](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#google)
- [OpenID Connect](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#openid-connect)
- [Token-based](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#token)

#### Bitbucket

Follow Bitbucket's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth Consumer](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/).

When creating the OAuth Consumer, you will need to provide the following values:

**Callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

**URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Permissions**:

Use this group of settings when using Bitbucket OAauth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  bitbucket:
    enabled: true
    clientId: OAauth Consumer Key
    clientSecret: OAauth Consumer Secret
    workspace: my-workspace
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#cloud-provider-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

The `workspace` field is optional. Only members of the workspace will be allowed to login into your Okteto instance. An empty `workspace` field permits any user to log in.

#### GitHub

> If you are planning on using the GitHub Integration, you should follow [this guide](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#creating-the-github-app). You'll then use the same Github Application for the Integration as the one from Oauth.

Follow GitHub's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

When creating the OAuth App, you will need to provide the following values:

**Homepage URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorization callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

Use this group of settings when using GitHub OAuth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  github:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientID
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    organization: my-org
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#cloud-provider-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

The `organization` field is optional. Only members of the organization will be allowed to log in into your Okteto instance. An empty `organization` field permits any user to log in.

We also have a video walking you through the steps on configuring GitHub as an authentication provider for your Okteto installation:

#### Google

Follow Google's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth 2.0 Client](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

When creating the OAUTH 2.0 Client, you will need to provide the following values:

**Authorized javascript origin**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

Use this group of settings when using Google OAuth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  google:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    allowDomains:
    - example.com
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#cloud-provider-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

The `allowDomains` field is optional. Only users with Google Workspace accounts that match one of the domains on the list will be allowed to log into your Okteto instance. An empty `allowDomains` field permits any user with a valid Google Workspace account to log in.

#### OpenID Connect

Follow your OpenID Connect service provider's documentation on how to create the required application.

Okteto supports any identity provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard. The following external identity providers have been tested with Okteto:

- [Azure Active Directory](self-hosted/guides/azure-active-directory/index.mdx)
- [Gitlab](self-hosted/guides/gitlab/index.mdx)
- [Okta](self-hosted/guides/okta/index.mdx)


> Are we missing your favorite identity provider? Open a feature request in the [Okteto Community](https://community.okteto.com/t/about-the-feature-requests-category/28) and let us know!

When creating the application, you'll need to provide the following values:

- Start SSO URL:  `https://okteto.DOMAIN`
- Redirect URIs: `https://okteto.DOMAIN`, `https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback`
- Scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`
- Response Type: `code`
- Grant Type: `authorization code`

Use this group of settings when using an OpenID Connect provider as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    group: my-group
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://your-provider
      authorization: https://your-provider/authorization
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
      groupsKey: groups
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#cloud-provider-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

The `group` field is optional. Only members of the group will be allowed to log in into your Okteto instance. An empty `group` field permits any user to log in.

The `issuer` and `authorization` endpoints must match the value returned in the provider config discovery.

The `mapping` fields are optional. Use them to configure the mapping between Okteto's user attributes and the claim coming from your authentication provider.

> Your provider needs to support the [UserInfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) in order to be used with Okteto. This authentication option follows the OpenID standard, and it has been validated with Okta, PingIdentity, and GitLab.

#### Token

Okteto defaults to token-based authentication to simplify the installation and configuration of Okteto self-hosted.

This enables you to use a token for a single user, login to the Okteto UI, and start exploring Okteto's features and functionality much faster than configuring other authentication methods.
Other authentication methods are more time-consuming and cumbersome to configure.

Once you've completed the initial configuration of Okteto using token-based authentication and explored the product, you can then switch to another authentication method.
Token-based authentication would no longer be ideal as you expand to multiple users and incorporating production environments into Okteto.


```yaml
auth:
  token:
    enabled: true
```

Follow our post-installation notes to learn how to login to the Okteto UI and configure your Okteto CLI with a randomly generated token.

### Theme

- `logo`: The logo displayed at the far top left of the Okteto UI. The value can be a url or a Base64 encoded image.
- `primary`: The primary color of the sidebar. This is used for the color of the sidebar. The value can be a [HTML color name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names) (e.g. blue, red) or a hexadecimal code.
- `secondary`: The secondary color of the sidebar. This is used for the icons and the text displayed in the sidebar. The value can be a [HTML color name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names) (e.g. blue, red) or a hexadecimal code.

```yaml
theme:
  logo: http://example.com/icon.png
  primary: \#EFF3F2
  secondary: black
```

- `persistence.cache`: The size (in Mi) of the buildkit cache to store image caches. It should be around 30Gi smaller than `storage.size`. Defaults to 500Gi.

```yaml
buildkit:
  port: 443
  extraEnv:
    - name: NO_PROXY
      value: ".example.com"
  replicaCount: 1
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: ssd
    size: 180Gi
    cache: 150000
```

In order to handle timeouts during communication between the client and the buildkit daemon, the following environment variables can be modified on the server side:

- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_TIME_MS`: After this duration of time, if the server doesn't see any activity it pings the client to see if the transport is still alive. If set below 1s, a minimum value of 1s will be used. The current default value is 2 hours.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS`: After having pinged for keepalive check, the server waits for a duration of Timeout and if no activity is seen, the connection is closed. The current default value is 20 seconds.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_IDLE_MS`: Duration for the amount of time after which an idle connection would be closed by sending a GOAWAY. Idleness duration is defined since the most recent time the number of outstanding RPCs became zero or the connection establishment. The current default value is infinity.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_AGE_MS`: Duration for the maximum amount of time a connection may exist before it will be closed by sending a GOAWAY. A random jitter of +/-10% will be added to the value to spread out connection storms. The current default value is infinity.

```

The defaultBackend provides the following features:

- Autowake namespaces: when a user access an endpoint from an slept namespace, the defaultBackend will issue a wake command.
- Custom error pages: when a user access an endpoint and an error is produced, the defaultBackend will return a custom error page with hints on how to solve it.

You can also restrict the nodes where the defaultBackend is deployed using [tolerations](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#tolerations):

```
tolerations:
  devPool: dev
```

#### storage

Okteto supports different storage drivers to store the images inside the [Okteto Registry](cloud/registry.mdx). Check out our video tutorial on how to configure a persistent storage for your Okteto installation:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaKc05Qzlvw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

##### filesystem

Set `filesystem.enabled` to true if you want to store the images in the container filesystem.
Additionally, set `filesystem.persistence.enabled` to true if you want to store the images in a PVC attached to the registry.
Both options might limit your ability to scale up the registry, depending on the type of storage you are using.
You can also customize the `storageClass` (optional), the `size` of the volume (defaults to 40Gi), or attach an existing volume claim via `claimName`.

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    filesystem:
      enabled: true
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        claimName: ""
        accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
        storageClass: ""
        size: 40Gi
```

##### azure

Use this to use Azure Storage to store your private images.

`STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY` refers to a storage account access key with read/write permissions to the storage container specified in the Okteto configuration.
Create a secret with the value of `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY` using the command below.


```console
$ kubectl create secret generic okteto-registry-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=secretKey=STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      azure:
        enabled: true
        storage:
          container: "storage-container-name"
          accountName: "service-account-name"
```

##### aws

Use this to use S3 to store your private images.

###### IAM Role for Service Account (recommended)

Use this option to give the registry pods a role to authenticate with the S3 bucket.

To do that, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      aws:
        enabled: true
        bucket: "bucket-name"
        region: "aws-region"
        iam:
          enabled: false
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: 'arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/okteto-registry-role-name'
```


###### IAM User

`IAM_SECRET_KEY` refers to the secret key of an IAM with read/write permissions to the bucket specified in the Okteto configuration.
Create a secret with the value of `IAM_SECRET_KEY` using the command below.


```console
$ kubectl create secret generic okteto-registry-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=secretKey=IAM_SECRET_KEY
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:


```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      aws:
        enabled: true
        bucket: "bucket-name"
        region: "aws-region"
        iam:
          enabled: true
          accessKeyID: "XXXXXX"
```

##### digitalocean

Use this to use DigitalOcean Spaces to store your private images.

`ACCESS_KEY` refers to the access key of the storage space specified in the Okteto configuration.
Create a secret with the value of `ACCESS_KEY` using the command below.

```console
$ kubectl create secret generic okteto-registry-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=secretKey=ACCESS_KEY
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      digitalocean:
        enabled: true
        space:
          name: "space-name"
          accessKeyID: "access-key"
```

##### gcp

Use this to use Google Cloud Storage to store your private images.

###### Workload Identity (recommended)

Use this option to configure the registry pods with a workload id to authenticate with the bucket.

To do that, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      gcp:
        enabled: true
        bucket: "bucket-name"
        project: "project-id"
        workloadIdentity:
          enabled: true
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: 'GSA_NAME@GSA_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
```

###### Service Account Key (JSON)

`key.json` refers to a file containing the key of a service account with read/write permissions to the storage bucket specified in the Okteto configuration.
Create a secret with the value of `key.json`  using the command below.

```console
$ kubectl create secret generic okteto-registry-secret --namespace=okteto --from-file=key=key.json
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file:

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      gcp:
        enabled: true
        bucket: "bucket-name"
        project: "project-id"
```

### telemetry

You can enable or disable the telemetry job. The telemetry job "phones home" once a day with the following information:

- Number of managed users
- Number of managed namespaces
- Kubernetes Version and Platform
- A unique install ID
- Your license ID.
- The name of the authentication provider
- The name of the cloud provider

Okteto uses the information to help us better understand how our customers use Okteto, as well as to help us prioritize fixes and features. We don't share your information with anyone else.

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```

If this configuration is disabled, Okteto CLI analytics are automatically disabled.

### webhook

The webhook service. Ingress creation, generation of hostnames, enforcement of policies, etc...

- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the webhook pods.
- `extraEnv`: Environment variables to be set on the webhook containers.
- `hostNetwork`: Enables or disables host networking for the webhook deployment. The default is false.
- `labels`: Labels to add to the webhook pods.
- `port`: Port sets the port used for the webhook deployment. The default is 443.
- `priorityClassName`: The priority class to be used by pods of this component.
- `replicaCount`: The number of webhook pods. It defaults to 2.
- `resources`: The resources for the webhook pods.
- `internalCertificate.annotations`: Annotations to add to the internal certificate generated for the webhook.

## Advanced Configuration

### affinity

Apply default affinities to pods deployed in namespaces created by Okteto.

- `devPool`: Affinities for pods created on namespaces managed by Okteto.
- `oktetoPool`: Affinities for pods created during the Okteto installation.

```yaml
affinity:
  devPool:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: cloud.google.com/spot
            operator: In
            values:
            - "true"
        weight: 10
  oktetoPool:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: dev.okteto.com/overloaded
            operator: DoesNotExist
        weight: 50
```

In this case, pods deployed in namespaces created by Okteto will have a preferred affinity to land on preemptible nodes.

### applications

- `repository`: The [Helm repository](cloud/deploy-from-helm.mdx) available for every developer. This is disabled by default. To enable, set the `applications.repository` property to your Helm registry URL

```yaml
applications:
  repository: "https://apps.okteto.com"
```

### clusterRole

Okteto assings this cluster role to every user via a namespace-scoped role binding.
The default value assigns each developer a `cluster-admin` role binding with only access to their personal namespaces.

```yaml
clusterRole: "cluster-admin"
```

### user extraRoleBindings

Extra `RoleBindings` to be created for every user's service account. This is useful if you want to grant access to resources in other namespaces of the cluster.  Disabled by default.

The `RoleBindings` will reference `ClusterRoles` and will be scoped to the `namespace` specified in the configuration. Okteto will not create neither the `ClusterRoles` nor the `Namespaces` and expects them to exist in the cluster. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
user:
  extraRoleBindings:
    enabled: true
    roleBindings:
      namespace-name1:
      - cluster-role1
      - cluster-role2
      namespace-name2:
      - cluster-role3
```

### convertLoadBalancedServices

Converts services with type LoadBalancer into ClusterIP and automatically creates an ingress. Enabled by default.

```yaml
convertLoadBalancedServices:
  enabled: true
```

### crds

Configures CRDs managed by Okteto

- `annotations`: The annotations to apply to the CRDs created during the Okteto installation.
- `keep`: Keep CRDs on chart uninstall (defaults to `true`).
- `install`: Install and upgrade CRDs on chart install (defaults to `true`).

```yaml
crds:
  install: true
  keep: true
  annotations: {}
```

### devStorageClass

Uses the specified storage class for all persistent volume claims created when developers execute `okteto up`. This setting will override any storage class defined on the [Okteto manifest](reference/manifest.mdx#persistentvolume-object-optional). Disabled by default.

- `storageClass`: The storage class enforced for persistent volume claims created by `okteto up`.

```yaml
devStorageClass:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: ebs-sc
```

There is only one exception where this storage class is overwritten. In case of having [volume snapshots feature](self-hosted/administration/volume-snapshots.mdx) configured, if a storage class is required for the snapshots that storage class will have preference.

### globalClusterRole

Okteto assings this cluster role to every user via a cluster role binding. By default, this behavior is disabled.
This can be useful to give access to cluster level resources to every developer account, like accessing the Node API.

```yaml
globalClusterRole: ""
```

### ingress

Configure default values for the ingress created by Okteto.

- `annotations`: The annotations to apply to all the ingresses created during the Okteto installation.
- `oktetoIngressClass`: The `ingressClassName` to apply to all the ingresses created during the Okteto installation (defaults to `nginx`).
- `class`: If specified, Okteto will set this as the `ingressClassName` of all ingresses managed by Okteto. This is useful if you have more than one ingress controller in your cluster.
- `forceIngressClass`: If enabled, all ingresses deployed in namespaces managed by Okteto will have the ingress class defined in  `ingress.class` (default: `false`).
- `forceIngressSubdomain`: If enabled, the subdomain of the host of all ingresses deployed in namespaces managed by Okteto must match the okteto wildcard subdomain (default: `true`).
- `ip`: The internal IP of the ingress. Pods will call the Okteto API and the Okteto Registry using this IP. Required if the installation of the Okteto [NGINX Ingress Controller](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#using-your-own-ingress-controller) is disabled.

```yaml
ingress:
  annotations: {}
  oktetoIngressClass: nginx
  class: nginx
  forceIngressClass: false
  forceIngressSubdomain: true
  ip: ""
```

### ingressLimits

Configure ingress connections limits for each public endpoint. Disabled by default.

- `connections`: Maximum parallel connections for each ingress.
- `rps`: Maximum requests per second for each ingress.
- `rpm`: Maximum requests per minute for each ingress.

```yaml
ingressLimits:
  enabled: true
  connections: 40
  rps: 40
  rpm: 400
```

### injectDevelopmentBinaries

Automatically inject kubectl, helm, and okteto binaries on every development environment, and on the git and helm deployment pipelines. This requires permissions to mount a host volume.

If this is disabled, you'll need to provide your own image in `installer.image`.

```yaml
injectDevelopmentBinaries:
  enabled: true
```

### namespace

Annotation and label customizations in namespaces created by Okteto.
These annotations and labels are additional to the ones already applied by Okteto.

- `annotations`: Annotations applied to each namespace created by Okteto.
- `labels`: Labels applied to each namespace created by Okteto.
- `ingress.annotations`: Annotations applied to ingresses in namespaces created by Okteto.
- `ingress.labels`: Labels applied to ingresses in namespaces created by Okteto.

```yaml
namespace:
  annotations:
    development: "true"
  labels:
    istio-injection: enabled
  ingress:
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/issuer: "letsencrypt"
    labels:
      development: "true"
```

### networkPolicies

Configures [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) for each namespace to isolate network traffic.
Disabled by default.

- `ingress`: Ingress list of rules ([NetworkPolicyIngressRule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#networkpolicyingressrule-v1-networking-k8s-io)) to be applied on every namespace managed by Okteto. (optional).
- `egress`: Egress list of rules ([NetworkPolicyEgressRule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#networkpolicyegressrule-v1-networking-k8s-io)) to be applied on every namespace managed by Okteto (optional).

```yaml
networkPolicies:
  enabled: false
  ingress: []
  egress: []
```

### podSecurityPolicy

Decide if you want [pod security policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) to be added to the service accounts created by Okteto.

#### enabled

Whether to enable pod security policy (defaults to `true`).

#### useAppArmor

Add the apparmor security annotations to the Okteto pod security policies. (defaults to `true`).

If `true` the following annotations are added to the existing pod security policy:

```yaml
apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default
```

```yaml
podSecurityPolicy:
   enabled: true
   useAppArmor: true
```

### overrideFileWatchers

Overrides the default kernel values for file watchers in every node. Recommended if you're running databases, or if you plan on using "okteto up" on the cluster. This requires permission to mount and modify /proc values.

- `maxUserWatches`: The maximum number of allowed inotify watchers.
- `maxMapCount`: The maximum number of memory map areas a process may have.
- `aioMaxNR`: The maximum number of allowable concurrent IO requests.

```yaml
overrideFileWatchers:
  enabled: true
  maxUserWatches: 10048576
  maxMapCount: 262144
  aioMaxNR: 1000000
```

### overrideRegistryResolution

Overrides the registry hostname resolution to use internal IPs. This requires permission to mount and modify the cluster nodes' /etc/hosts file.

```yaml
overrideRegistryResolution:
  enabled: true
```

### prepullImages

Pre-pull the git and helm installer images in all the nodes. This requires permission to mount the docker socket.

```yaml
prepullImages:
  enabled: true
```

### privateRegistry

A list of private registries and its corresponding credentials. The kubelet will use them when pulling images:

```yaml
privateRegistry:
  hub:
    url: https://index.docker.io/v1/
    user: username1
    password: password1
  gcr:
    url: https://gcr.io
    token: dXNlcjM6cGFzc3dvcmQzCg==
  aws:
    url: 536194259215.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    user: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    password: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

> Use `token` if your registry does not support username/password authentication (e.g. google registry).

> If you are using an AWS private registry, Okteto takes care of refreshing docker credentials every 4 hours.

You can use this to configure a Docker Hub account for your cluster in order to avoid DockerHub's pull limits.
Be careful, a credential misconfiguration could lead to an issue where kubelet cannot pull public images from Docker Hub.
If this happens, [follow these instructions](self-hosted/install/troubleshooting.mdx#private-image-registry-credentials-misconfiguration) to recover from this state.

### pullAlways

Forces the `PullAlways` image pull policy in the cluster. Enabled by default.

```yaml
pullAlways:
  enabled: true
```

### quickstarts

      memory: "50Mi"
    limits:
      enabled: true
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "8Gi"
```

### secret

Labels and annotations to include in the secret created by the chart. Useful if you want to integrate with Vault or similar secret stores.

```yaml
secret:
  annotations:
    your.custom.annotation: "10"
  labels:
    your.custom.label: "20"
```

### tolerations

Indicates [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for the okteto components.
Define the label and taint `okteto-node-pool` on your worker nodes to match these values.

- `oktetoPool`: Tolerations for the api, webhook, gc, autoscaler, ingress controller, and frontend services.
- `buildPool`: Tolerations for the buildkit and registry services.
- `devPool`: Tolerations for the pods deployed in namespaces created by okteto.

```yaml
tolerations:
  oktetoPool: okteto
  buildPool: build
  devPool: dev
```

For example, if you add the label `okteto-node-pool:build` and the taint `okteto-node-pool=build:NoSchedule` to a node, and you
are using `buildPool: build`, the buildkit and registry pods are deployed to this node.

### userDefinedNamespaces

Disable if you want to enforce using the `username` as a suffix on namespaces and ingress hosts. Enabled by default.

```yaml
userDefinedNamespaces: false
```

### userPodAffinity

When enabled Okteto automatically adds a preferred affinity to every pod, which leans towards placing pods from the same namespace and in the same node (default: `true`).

 - `antiAffinity`: When enabled Okteto adds an anti-affinity to the pod to ensure that all pods in the same namespace are placed in the same node. Disabled by default

```yaml
userPodAffinity:
  enabled: true
  antiAffinity:
    enabled: false
```

### virtualServices

When enabled, the Okteto UI will show the public endpoints associated with [Istio Virtual Services](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) (default: `false`).

```yaml
virtualServices:
  enabled: false
```

### volumes

Allows you to specify different settings for volumes.

 - `validate`: Section to configure volume validation.
  - `enabled`: Enables volume validation. Disabled by default
  - `supportedStorageClasses`: List of supported storage classes.
  - `forceStorageClass`: Flag to specify if the storage class should be enforced in case of creating a volume with a non-supported storage class. If set, the first storage class specified on `supportedStorageClasses` will be the enforced value.
  - `supportedAccessModes`: List of supported access modes.

```yaml
volumes:
  validate:
    enabled: true
    supportedStorageClasses: ["standard", "standard-rwo"]
    forceStorageClass: true
    supportedAccessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
```

### volumeSnapshots

Enables users to initialize persistent volume claims with the contents of a preexisting volume snapshot.

This feature requires having a CSI driver installed in your cluster.

- `driver`: The name of the CSI driver used when creating snapshots.
- `class`: The VolumeSnapshotClass of the volume snapshot.
- `storageClass`: The storage class required by volumes initialized from snapshots (optional).
- `enableNamespaceAccessValidation`: When enabled, only users that have access to the namespace where the volume snapshot is stored will be able to use it in their development environments. Default false.
- `allowIDAnnotation`: Allow using your cloud provider's snapshot ID as the source of the data. Default true.

```yaml
volumeSnapshots:
  enabled: true
  driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
  class: snapclass
  storageClass: ebs-sc
```

Add the `dev.okteto.com/from-snapshot-id` annotation to any persistent volume claim to tell Okteto to initialize your persistent volume claim, as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/from-snapshot-id: snap-xxxxxxxx
  name: pvc-name
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

When a persistent volume claim resource is created, Okteto will import the snapshot in Kubernetes using a [VolumeSnapshotContent](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) and will set the source of your persistent volume claim to this VolumeSnapshotContent.

### wildcardCertificate

Disable if you want to bring your own certificates and/or certificate authority. Enabled by default.

- `create`: If set to false, Okteto will not create the wildcard certificate automatically.
- `duration`: The duration of the certificate. Ignored if `create` is set to `false`.
- `name`: The name of the secret where the certificate will be stored.
- `privateCA.enabled`: Set to true when using a private certificate authority.
- `privateCA.secret.name`: The name of the secret that stores the private certificate authority's certificate.
- `privateCA.secret.key`: The key in the secret that stores the private certificate authority's certificate.
- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the wildcard certificate generated by Okteto.

```yaml
wildcardCertificate:
  create: true
  duration: 2160h0m0s
  name: default-ssl-certificate
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous
  # if using a private CA, specify the name of the TLS secret that stores the certificate
  privateCA:
    enabled: false
    secret:
      name: "okteto-ca"
      key: "ca.crt"
```

### user

#### serviceAccount

The configured annotations and labels are additional to the ones already applied by Okteto.

- `annotations`: Annotations added to each service account generated by Okteto for user accounts.
- `labels`: Labels added to each service account generated by Okteto for user accounts.

```yaml
user:
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      custom.annotation/one: one
      custom.annotation/two: two
    labels:
      custom.label/one: one
      custom.label/two: two
```

A common use case for adding service account annotations is to [get access via IAM Roles or Workload Identity](https://community.okteto.com/t/support-for-gke-workload-identities-for-okteto-self-hosted/39/4) to create Cloud resources as part of your Okteto Manifest `deploy` commands.

- [Azure Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/)
- [GKE Workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
- [AWS IAM Roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)

### privateEndpoints

When [publicOverride](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#publicoverride) is set, Okteto Self Hosted deploys an additional component for [Okteto Private Endpoints](cloud/private-endpoints.mdx) feature, which is responsible for authenticating and authorizing requests sent to Okteto Endpoints set to private mode.

- `port`: Internal port used for the Private Endpoint component. Defaults to `8080`.
- `resources`: The resources for the Private Endpoint component pods.
- `replicaCount`: The number of Private Endpoint component pods. It defaults to 1.
- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the Private Endpoint component pods.

By default, the Private Endpoint component will inherit the configuration set at the [`auth`] section, but you can override some values with the following properties:

- `clientID`: Overrides `auth.*.clientID`.
- `clientSecret`: Overrides `auth.*.clientSecret`.

## Dependencies

Okteto will automatically install two instances of [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) as part of the default installation, using its official [Helm chart](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx).

Each instance has an specific role:

- `ingress-nginx`: ingress-controller that serves all the inbound traffic to the Okteto cluster, including Buildkit, Registry, Okteto API, Okteto Frontend and users' ingresses.
- `okteto-nginx`: ingress-controller dedicated to serve users' ingresses inbound traffic. By default, it is deployed behind `ingress-nginx`.

### Okteto Ingress Controllers

Okteto has two nginx-related keys you can define in your configuration file (e.g. `config.yaml` or any other config file where you specify these keys): `ingress-nginx` and `okteto-nginx`. These each serve a different function.

#### ingress-nginx

This key is used to specify ingress behavior for Okteto's platform components (e.g. api, buildkit, registry) and supports passthrough/proxy behavior to `okteto-nginx`. This configuration will serve through a `*.$subdomain` internal ingress pointing to `okteto-nginx`. This ingress controller resides within the control plane of the Okteto cluster.

#### okteto-nginx

This key is used to specify ingress behavior specifically for development environments. This configuration is used to parse and register developer ingresses. This ingress controller resides within the cluster and manages ingress to and between developer applications.

A practical example of how these two ingress controllers interaction is: when a new user request arrives to Okteto it will be served by `ingress-nginx`, which will proxy it to `okteto-nginx`. Then `okteto-nginx` will proxy the request to the backend pod.

#### Sample configuration

One example of modifying the Okteto ingress controllers, to change the number of replicas in `ingress-nginx`, looks like this:

```yaml
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    replicaCount: 2
```

The full list of values is [available here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/charts/ingress-nginx/values.yaml).

#### ingress-nginx & okteto-nginx default values

Okteto sets specific values on the embedded ingress-nginx chart to enable features dependent on the ingress-controller. The values can be checked with the following command:

- `ingress-nginx`:
  ```
  helm get values okteto/okteto --jsonpath '{.ingress-nginx}'
  ```

- `okteto-nginx`:
  ```
  helm get values okteto/okteto --jsonpath '{.okteto-nginx}'
  ```

#### Using Your Own Ingress Controller

Refer to this [community guide](https://community.okteto.com/t/how-do-i-configure-my-own-ingress-controller/887) for detailed instructions on disabling the Okteto Nginx Ingress Controller and exposing Okteto behind your own Ingress Controller.

## Store Sensitive Configuration Values using a Secret

Create a secret named `okteto-cloud-secret` to store the following values instead of setting them in your helm configuration file:

- `OKTETO_LICENSE`: use this instead of `.Values.license` in your helm configuration file.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET`: use this instead of `.Values.auth.google.clientSecret` in your helm configuration file.
- `GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET`: use this instead of `.Values.auth.github.clientSecret` in your helm configuration file.
- `BITBUCKET_CLIENTSECRET`: use this instead of `.Values.auth.bitbucket.clientSecret` in your helm configuration file.
- `OPENID_CLIENTSECRET`: use this instead of `.Values.auth.openid.clientSecret` in your helm configuration file.
- `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENTSECRET`: use this instead of `.Values.github.clientSecret` in your helm configuration file.
- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: use this instead of `.Values.github.appPrivateKey` in your helm configuration file.
