This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). We'll be focusing exclusively on AKS in order to keep it as simple as possible.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you'll need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)
- An Okteto License

### Subdomain

You'll need access to a subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.

This guide will assume that your domain is registered in [AzureDNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview). Other DNS services can be used, but aren't covered here.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow Azure's [cluster creation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough) and check our [preparation guide](get-started/preparation.mdx#deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster).

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.
Run the following command to obtain your cluster's API server endpoint:

```
kubectl config view --minify | grep server
```

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.

### Installing kubectl

Follow Azure's documentation for [installing kubectl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-clusterl). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to talk to your new cluster.

### Installing Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository in order to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

You'll receive a license key as part of your subscription to Okteto. If you haven't received it, [please open a support ticket](https://okteto.com/support).

## Installing Okteto

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Download a copy of the [Okteto AKS configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/aks/config.yaml), open it, and update the following values:

- Your `license`
- A `subdomain`
- Your cluster's API server endpoint

For example:

```yaml
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://XXXXXX.aks.microsoft.com"

buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true

registry:
  storage:
    filesystem:
      persistence:
        enabled: true
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --create-namespace
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
```

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by AKS to the NGINX Ingress we've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP                          PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller  LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    a519c8b3b27f94...aks.microsoft.com   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. In AzureDNS, this is done by creating an `A` record with the name  `*`, pointing to the IP of the Load Balancer.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

After a successful installation, you can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully login into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.

> **Important**: The default installation is not recommended for production use. We highly advise following the steps outlined in the [Admin Dashboard](administration/dashboard.mdx#installation) before giving your team access to your Okteto instance.

The default installation is all that's required to follow our [getting started](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) guide.
