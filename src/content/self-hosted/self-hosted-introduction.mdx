Okteto is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of the [Okteto Development Platform](/), with the control and flexibility of running in your Kubernetes infrastructure.

With Okteto your team can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](/) or from your [Git Repositories](deploy/deploy-from-git).
- Configure [Secrets](deploy/manifest/secrets) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](manage-app/automatic-ssl) for your services, [Private Endpoints](manage-app/private-endpoints) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](manage-app/custom-domains).
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](deploy/components/build-service).
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](deploy/components/build-registry).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](manage-app/namespaces) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](deploy/components/kubernetes-credentials) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Collaborate by [sharing](manage-app/namespaces/#share-your-namespace) your namespaces with your teammates
- Keep your infrastructure under control with the Okteto [Garbage Collector](manage-okteto/cleanup) and the [Okteto Autoscaler](get-started/configure/configuration-settings/#autoscaler)
