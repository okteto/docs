# Use Azure Active Directory as your Identity Provider<TiersList tiers="Self-Hosted" />

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure Azure Active Directory as the authentication provider for your Okteto instace.

Please refer to [Azure's official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings) on Open ID Connect for more information.

## Prerequisites

- An instance of [Okteto](https://okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/).
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0+ installed in your local machine.
- Access to an [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com) with permissions to registrate applications in Azure Active Directory.

## Create an App Registration

Create a [new app integration](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false), using the values below:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/new-app.png").default}
    alt="Create the new App Registration"
  />
</p>

Then, fill in the following values on the “Register an application” window:

1. Name: The name of your application (e.g. `okteto`)
2. Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)
3. Redirect URI: https://okteto.{YOUR_DOMAIN}/auth/callback

Once the application has been created, save the `Application (client) ID` value. You'll need it to configure your Okteto Instance.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/client-id.png").default}
    alt="Copy the Tenant ID"
  />
</p>

Copy the `Directory (tenant) ID` value`. You'll need it to configure your Okteto Instance.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/tenant-id.png").default}
    alt="Copy the Tenant ID"
  />
</p>

On the left menu, click on "Certificates & secrets". Create a "New client secret" and copy the `Value`. You'll need it to configure your Okteto Instance.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/secrets.png").default}
    alt="Copy the Secret ID and Value"
  />
</p>

On the lest menu, click on "API permissions" and grant the following permissions:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/permissions.png").default}
    alt="Grant permissions"
  />
</p>

## Configure Okteto

Once you have the Okta application ready, you'll need to update the configuration of your Okteto Self-Hosted instance.

First, update the auth section of your Helm configuration file (e.g. `values.yaml` ) with the values you obtained on the first step of this guide:

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://sts.windows.net/$TENANT_ID/
      authorization: https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: email
```

> You can also store the value of clientSecret [as a secret directly in Kubernetes](reference/helm-chart-values.mdx/#store-sensitive-configuration-values-using-a-secret).

Then, [upgrade your installation](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) to apply the changes. We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

Once the upgrade has been completed, go to your instance and click on the **Log In** button to access your instance. If everything is configured correctly, Okteto will now use your Azure Active Directory for user authentication.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/with-azure.png").default}
    alt="Log in with Azure Active Directory"
  />
</p>

### Customize the attributes that Okteto consumes

By default, Okteto will use the following attributes below when creating a user:

- `Name` as the display name of the user.
- `Nickname` as the username of the user.
- `Email` as the email.
- `Picture URL` for the user's profile picture.

If you are not using some of those values, or you want to customize which attributes get mapped, you can customize that by using the `mapping` field inside the `openid` key in your Helm configuration file.

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://sts.windows.net/$TENANT_ID/
      authorization: https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
```

The value of every key in the `mapping` section must match a `claim` in your Azure Active Directory + OpenID configuration, and it must contain a non-empty value.
