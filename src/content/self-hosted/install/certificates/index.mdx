# Configure the Okteto Wildcard Certificate

By default, Okteto will create a self-signed wildcard certificate for your cluster. This certificate is used to secure communication to the Okteto UI, the build service, the registry service, and to all the applications that use [Automatic SSL Endpoints](core/endpoints/automatic-ssl.mdx).

In a production environment, you should use your own certificates rather than let Okteto create a self-signed wildcard certificate for you. You can configure your wildcard certificate using any of the following approaches:

- [Cert-manager and Letâ€™s Encrypt](cert-manager.mdx)
- [Amazon Certificate Manager](aws-acm.mdx)
- [Bring your own certificate](bring-your-own-certificate.mdx)

If you cannot use wildcard certificates, our community mainstains a guide to explain [how to install Okteto without a wildcard certificate](https://community.okteto.com/t/how-do-i-install-okteto-without-a-wildcard-certificate/796).
