Okteto provides a diagnostics tool through the [Replicated Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh) framework. This tool completely optional but can help troubleshoot complex issues, specially if you are getting assistance through Okteto Support.

## Installation

You'll need to install the `kubectl` plugins:

```bash
kubectl krew install preflight
kubectl krew install support-bundle
```

More info about installation [here](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/#installation).

# Preflight

Provides sanity checks for the okteto installation.

Simply run:

```
kubectl preflight -n okteto https://downloads.okteto.com/diagnostics/preflight.yaml
```

This is in interactive command that will provide a summary of the state of the cluster that are relevant for the okteto installation:


{/* TODO: Add GIF or image showing what this looks like */}


# Support bundle

Creates a gzipped tarball which includes cluster information, logs for okteto components, and other relevant information

```
kubectl support-bundle \
  --interactive=false \
  --debug \
  -n okteto \
  -o okteto-support.tar.gz \
  https://downloads.okteto.com/diagnostics/support-bundle.yaml
```

This bundle can help troubleshoot issues with the cluster specially in an incident in which you are getting assistance from Okteto Support.
