This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure Bitbucket as the authentication provider for Okteto.

Please refer to [Bitbucket's official documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/) on how to create an OAuth Consumer for more information.

## Prerequisites

- A working installation of [Okteto](get-started/install/index.mdx)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0+ installed in your local machine
- Access to a [Bitbucket account](https://bitbucket.org/) with permissions to create an OAuth Consumer

## Create the OAuth Consumer

When creating the OAuth Consumer, you will need to provide the following values:

**Callback URL**:

```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

**URL**:

```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Permissions**:
Account: Email
Account: Read

Copy the `OAuth Consumer Key` and `OAuth Consumer Secret` values. You'll need them to configure Okteto.

## Configure Okteto

Once you have the Bitbucket OAuth Consumer ready, update the `auth` section of your Helm configuration file with the following values:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
auth:
  bitbucket:
    enabled: true
    // highlight-next-line
    clientId: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY"
    // highlight-next-line
    clientSecret: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET"
    // highlight-next-line
    workspace: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE"
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#store-sensitive-configuration-values-using-a-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

[Upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

The `workspace` field is optional. Only members of the workspace will be allowed to login into Okteto.
An empty `workspace` field permits any user to log in.
