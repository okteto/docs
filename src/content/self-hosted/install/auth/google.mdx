This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure Google as the authentication provider for Okteto.

Please refer to [Google's official documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) on how to create an OAuth 2.0 Client for more information.

## Prerequisites

- A working installation of [Okteto](get-started/install/index.mdx)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0+ installed in your local machine
- Access to a [Google account](https://cloud.google.com/) with permissions to create an OAuth 2.0 Client

## Create the OAuth 2.0 Client

When creating the OAUTH 2.0 Client, you will need to provide the following values:

**Authorized javascript origin**:

```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorized redirect URIs**:

```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

Copy the `Client Secret` value. You'll need it to configure Okteto.

## Configure Okteto

Once you have the Google OAuth 2.0 Client ready, update the `auth` section of your Helm configuration file with the following values:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
auth:
  google:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com
    // highlight-next-line
    clientId: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"
    allowDomains:
      - example.com
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#store-sensitive-configuration-values-using-a-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

[Upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

The `allowDomains` field is optional. Only users with Google Workspace accounts that match one of the domains on the list will be allowed to log into your Okteto instance.
An empty `allowDomains` field permits any user with a valid Google Workspace account to log in.
