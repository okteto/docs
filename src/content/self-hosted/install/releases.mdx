## 1.8.0
10 May, 2023

### Before you upgrade

Okteto 1.8 includes a change in the ingress architecture. If you're using your own ingress controller instead of the ingress-controller embedded with Okteto chart, please checkout the updated section about ["How to use your own ingress controller"](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#using-your-own-ingress-controller).

### Breaking changes

- The default value for the buildkit service session affinity is now `None`. To keep using `ClientIP` as `sessionAffinity` you need to set `service.sessionAffinity: ClientIP` in your [buildkit configuration](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit).

### Deprecation Notice

- Support for Kubernetes [1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Features

- Kubernetes supported versions: [1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) ([upgrade guide](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx/#upgrade-to-kubernetes-125)), [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) and [1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md).
- Support for custom [labels and annotations](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#namespace) in ingresses managed by Okteto.
- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.15.2](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.15.2)
  - Okteto CLI 2.15.2 enables the optimisation removed at Okteto CLI 2.14.3. Now we calculate a hash for a given commit with the info around the build.
- Oketo Self-Hosted will now show the [installation setup guide](administration/dashboard/#installation) by default
- External resources can now be destroyed from the Okteto UI
- External resources now supports [additional icons](reference/manifest.mdx##icon-string-optional)
- Ingresses are now served through two ingress-controllers instances, enabling flexible configuration and improving connection stability.
  - `ingress-nginx` will continue to be the main gateway for all inbound traffic to Okteto, but will stop processing individual users' ingresses. Instead it will forward users' ingresses to the new `okteto-nginx`.
  - `okteto-nginx` sits behind `ingress-nginx` and it process exclusively users' ingresses.
  - For additional configuration of both instances, please check the [ingress-controller configuration section](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#nginx-ingress-controller).
- Okteto Ingress [defaultBackend](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#defaultbackend) is now deployed separately of `ingress-nginx` or `okteto-nginx`.

### Improvements

- All external services created or updated by Okteto will now have the `dev.okteto.com/namespace` label
- Improved the performance of the query for retrieving endpoints for a preview environment using the `dev.okteto.com/namespace` label
- Support baggage header for istio divert driver
- Remove the `email` field from the helm values file. It is is now provided by the license
- Divert virtual service transformation is now done at the mutation webhook by adding the annotation to the virtualservices
- The frontend app now uses proper browser history routing instead of hash routing
- Catalog items are now sorted, by default, in the same way in both the admin dashboard and a developer's deploy/redeploy modal
- Using personal repositories from Bitbucket is now possible as we've addressed an issue with restricted characters in repository names
- Persistent spaces can no longer be put to sleep from the admin dashboard
- Improve text readability on deploy resources list

### Bugfixes

- Fix preview delete confirm modal stating "Delete namespace"
- Tabs in the admin panel are now appropriately responsive for smaller screens and resolutions. The last tabs will now wrap properly
- External Resources markdown inline code is now rendered correctly as inline instead of a fenced code block
- Translation browser extensions causing blank screens due to modifying DOM
- Show endpoints coming from virtual services in the Preview List view
- Move cache headers from `meta` to nginx so `Cache-Control` headers are applied correctly
- Show "managed by" message only when adding a repository to previews and not when launching a developement environment
- Force non-breaking spaces for leading whitespace on logs
- Fix panic produced when deploying a repository with trailing slash
- Add disable state to external resources when being destroyed

## 1.7.1
21 April, 2023

### Bugfixes

- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.14.3](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.14.3).
  - Okteto CLI 2.14.0 introduced an optimization to build only once the image for a given commit. Okteto CLI 2.14.3 disables this optimization while we fix some inconsistencies around its behavior

## 1.7.0
12 April, 2023

### Removal Notice
- Kubernetes [1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md) is no longer supported.

### Deprecation Notice

The `cloud.provider` and `cloud.secret` keys in the Helm chart are now deprecated and they will be removed in the future 2.x release. Instead, you can now use [`registry.storage.provider`](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#storage) and [`registry.secret`](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#registry) to configure the registry to use external storage. This change is backward compatible: the old configuration keys will continue to work until they are removed in 2.x. You can follow our [upgrade guide](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx#upgrading-to-1x).

### Features

- Kubernetes supported versions: [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) and [1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md).

- Support for configuring the [service account](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit) of buildkit.
- Support for [token-based authentication](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#token) to simplify the installation of Okteto Self-Hosted.
- [Personal Access Tokens](cloud/personal-access-tokens.mdx) will automatically expire after 180 days. For existing tokens, the expiration date will be set to 180 days from when your Okteto instance is upgraded to 1.7 or newer versions
- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.14.2](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.14.2)
- Upgraded ingress-nginx to [4.3.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/helm-chart-4.3.0)
- You can now delete external resources from the UI
- The default installation of Okteto doesn't require an external storage for the [registry](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#registry). It now uses [filesystem storage](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#filesystem) by default
- The default installation of Okteto doesn't require a PVC for [BuildKit](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit). It now uses filesystem storage by default

### Improvements

- When `buildkit.ingress.enabled` is true, BuildKit is exposed in the `buildkit.service.port` instead of port 1234. This makes it easier to use your with other ingress controllers
- We optimized the redeploy dialog experience. Infomation loads faster in the dialog, specially when the source is GitHub
- Improved confirmation dialogs messages
- When your Okteto instance doesn't have an auth provider configured, the login screen shows a message with a link to the documentation on how to configure it
- Pod Security Policies are not installed if they are not available in the cluster

### Bugfixes

- When redeploying a dev environment from the UI, there was a race condition that was preventing to use the right environment configuration (manifest, variables, branch, etc...)
- Sleeping resources now renders `No output.` logs instead of `Loading output...`
- Install and destroy jobs are retried when they fail due to transient errors during their execution
- Avoid panics in private endpoints when the user is not authenticated
- `Sleep` option is not available in the list of namespace actions when the namespace is persistent
- Fixed a problem when destroying dev environments from the UI when the manifest has defined an `image` property within the `destroy` section that was preventing the dev environment to be destroyed
- Fixed a problem when destroying dev environments with a variable declared in a multiline `destroy` command
- External resources were not being grouped under the corresponding dev environment when there was an error in the deployment of the environment

## 1.6.0
15 March, 2023

### Breaking changes

This version comes with a breaking change. The default ingress class for ingresses managed by Okteto changed from `nginx` to `okteto-nginx`  to prevent collisions with other controllers that might be already installed in the cluster. There is no action required from the user,  all ingresses managed by Okteto will be automatically updated as part of the upgrade.

If you want to continue to use the previous ingress class (`nginx`), you can do it by setting the following values in your helm values file:

```yaml
ingress:
  class: nginx
  oktetoIngressClass: nginx
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    ingressClass: nginx
    ingressClassResource:
      name: nginx
      controllerValue: "k8s.io/ingress-nginx"
```

In some cases, there is a race condition recreating the controller pods in which a controller pod starts before the new ingress class is created in the cluster and that generates 404 errors when accessing Okteto or dev environments. For that reason, we recommend to rollout the ingress controller deployment to avoid this issue (`kubectl rollout restart deployment <ingress-controller-deployment-name> -n okteto`).
