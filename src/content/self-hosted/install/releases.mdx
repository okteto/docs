## 1.8.0
10 May, 2023

### Breaking changes

- The default value for the buildkit service session affinity is now `None`. To keep using `ClientIP` as `sessionAffinity` you need to set `service.sessionAffinity: ClientIP` in your [buildkit configuration](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit).

### Deprecation Notice

- Support for Kubernetes [1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Features

- Kubernetes supported versions: [1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) ([upgrade guide](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx/#upgrade-to-kubernetes-125)), [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) and [1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md).
- Support for custom [labels and annotations](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#namespace) in ingresses managed by Okteto.
- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.15.2](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.15.2)
  - Okteto CLI 2.15.2 enables the optimisation removed at Okteto CLI 2.14.3. Now we calculate a hash for a given commit with the info around the build.
- Self-hosted will now show an installation setup guide by default
- Always use the baggage header for istio divert driver
- Remove the `email` field from the helm values file. It is is now provided by the license
- PSA Okteto Admission Webhook for restrictive PSP emulation
- Divert virtual service transformation is now done at the mutation webhook by adding the annotation to the virtualservices
- The frontend app now uses proper browser history routing instead of hash routing
- Catalog items are now sorted in the same way in both the admin dashboard and a developer's deploy/redeploy modal
- External resources can now be destroyed from the Okteto UI
- External resources now supports [additional icons](reference/manifest.mdx##icon-string-optional)

### Improvements

- Added service in the mutation webhook to add the `dev.okteto.com/namespace` label to all external resources created or updated
- Improved the performance of the query for retrieving endpoints for a preview environment using the `dev.okteto.com/namespace` label

### Bugfixes

- When a namespace is going to sleeping state, ingress class for ingresses at that namespace will only change under activation of unsupported flag
- Custom endpoints annotation `dev.okteto.com/endpoints` is now mapped with the correct service of an ingress
- Using personal repositories from Bitbucket is now possible as we've addressed an issue with restricted characters in repository names
- Update proper link to external storage documentation in the installation dashboard
- Fixed text in the UI is garbled when the deployment fails to be destroyed
- Fix preview delete confirm modal stating "Delete namespace"
- Tabs in the admin panel are now appropriately responsive for smaller screens and resolutions. The last tabs will now wrap properly
- When a license is not found, an error will now be thrown in the Fatal log
- External Resources markdown code is now displayed as an inline item instead of a standalone row block  
- Set `<html translate="no">` so the major translation extensions (the ones that respect this attribute) will take the attribute into account and prevent translations (and their DOM manipulation) to happen.
- Persistent spaces can no longer be put to sleep from the admin dashboard
- Show endpoints coming from virtual services in the Preview List view
- Google OAuth now works consistently
- Move cache headers from `meta` to nginx so `Cache-Control` headers are applied correctly
- Show "managed by" message only when adding a repository to previews and not when launching a developement environment
- Force non-breaking spaces for leading whitespace on logs
- Fix panic produced when deploying a repository with trailing slash
- Add disable state to external resources when being destroyed

## 1.7.1
21 April, 2023

### Bugfixes

  - Okteto CLI 2.14.0 introduced an optimization to build only once the image for a given commit. Okteto CLI 2.14.3 disables this optimization while we fix some inconsistencies around its behavior

## 1.7.0
12 April, 2023

### Removal Notice
- Kubernetes [1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md) is no longer supported.

### Deprecation Notice

The `cloud.provider` and `cloud.secret` keys in the Helm chart are now deprecated and they will be removed in the future 2.x release. Instead, you can now use [`registry.storage.provider`](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#storage) and [`registry.secret`](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#registry) to configure the registry to use external storage. This change is backward compatible: the old configuration keys will continue to work until they are removed in 2.x. You can follow our [upgrade guide](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx#upgrading-to-1x).

### Features

- Kubernetes supported versions: [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) and [1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md).
- Support for the annotation [dev.okteto.com/endpoints](cloud/ssl.mdx#customizing-the-endpoints-shown-in-the-okteto-ui) to customize the endpoints shown in the Okteto UI.
- Support for configuring the [service account](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit) of buildkit.
- Support for [token-based authentication](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#token) to simplify the installation of Okteto Self-Hosted.
- [Personal Access Tokens](cloud/personal-access-tokens.mdx) will automatically expire after 180 days. For existing tokens, the expiration date will be set to 180 days from when your Okteto instance is upgraded to 1.7 or newer versions
- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.14.2](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.14.2)
- Upgraded ingress-nginx to [4.3.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/helm-chart-4.3.0)
- You can now delete external resources from the UI
- The default installation of Okteto doesn't require an external storage for the [registry](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#registry). It now uses [filesystem storage](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#filesystem) by default
- The default installation of Okteto doesn't require a PVC for [BuildKit](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit). It now uses filesystem storage by default

### Improvements

- When `buildkit.ingress.enabled` is true, BuildKit is exposed in the `buildkit.service.port` instead of port 1234. This makes it easier to use your with other ingress controllers
- We optimized the redeploy dialog experience. Infomation loads faster in the dialog, specially when the source is GitHub
- Improved confirmation dialogs messages
- When your Okteto instance doesn't have an auth provider configured, the login screen shows a message with a link to the documentation on how to configure it
- Pod Security Policies are not installed if they are not available in the cluster

### Bugfixes

- When redeploying a dev environment from the UI, there was a race condition that was preventing to use the right environment configuration (manifest, variables, branch, etc...)
- Sleeping resources now renders `No output.` logs instead of `Loading output...`
- Install and destroy jobs are retried when they fail due to transient errors during their execution
- Avoid panics in private endpoints when the user is not authenticated
- `Sleep` option is not available in the list of namespace actions when the namespace is persistent
- Fixed a problem when destroying dev environments from the UI when the manifest has defined an `image` property within the `destroy` section that was preventing the dev environment to be destroyed
- Fixed a problem when destroying dev environments with a variable declared in a multiline `destroy` command
- External resources were not being grouped under the corresponding dev environment when there was an error in the deployment of the environment

## 1.6.0
15 March, 2023

### Breaking changes

This version comes with a breaking change. The default ingress class for ingresses managed by Okteto changed from `nginx` to `okteto-nginx`  to prevent collisions with other controllers that might be already installed in the cluster. There is no action required from the user,  all ingresses managed by Okteto will be automatically updated as part of the upgrade.

If you want to continue to use the previous ingress class (`nginx`), you can do it by setting the following values in your helm values file:

```yaml
ingress:
  class: nginx
  oktetoIngressClass: nginx
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    ingressClass: nginx
    ingressClassResource:
      name: nginx
      controllerValue: "k8s.io/ingress-nginx"
```

In some cases, there is a race condition recreating the controller pods in which a controller pod starts before the new ingress class is created in the cluster and that generates 404 errors when accessing Okteto or dev environments. For that reason, we recommend to rollout the ingress controller deployment to avoid this issue (`kubectl rollout restart deployment <ingress-controller-deployment-name> -n okteto`).
