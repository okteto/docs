## Upgrading to 0.10.x

Due to changes in the official NGINX ingress chart name, the name of the NGINX ingress configuration key in the Helm configuration file has changed from `nginx-ingress` to `ingress-nginx`. Please update your [ingress-nginx](/docs/self-hosted/administration/configuration/#ingress-nginx) configuration, if required, before upgrading your Okteto instance.

Note that upgrading to 0.10.x **will recreate your NGINX ingress load balancer**.  Depending on your cloud provider and load balancer's configuration, the new load balancer might have a new IP assigned. If this is the case, you'll need to update the DNS entry of your Okteto instance accordingly.

##  Upgrade your Okteto Instance

To upgrade a new release, modify the `config.yaml` with your desired changes and then use:

```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade <your-release-name> okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version <version_number>
```

For example:
```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version 0.9.x
```
*You can use `helm ls` to find the name of your release.*

Please review [the release notes](/docs/self-hosted/install/releases/) before upgrading. New features, known issues, and configuration changes will be listed there.

## Upgrading to 1.x

Okteto 1.0 has two major breaking changes that you need to be aware of before upgrading:

- The helm chart has been renamed from `okteto-enterprise` to `okteto`. All the resources created by the chart will have `okteto` as their prefix instead of `okteto-enterprise`. This change will cause all resources to be recreated upon upgrade.  Depending on your cloud provider and your networking configuration, you might need to update the DNS entry of the [build service](/docs/enterprise/administration/configuration/#buildkit) after upgrading your Okteto instance.
- The helm chart doesn't install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) by default.

We recommend that you follow the steps below to reduce the disruption of the service to a minimum:

#### Before upgrade

You can skip this step if you are [bringing your own certificates](/docs/enterprise/administration/certificates/), 
You can check if this is the case by seeing that the wildcard creation is disabled in the Okteto helm values configuration:

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
```

If the helm chart is generating the certificates for you,  run the following command from your command line to make sure `helm upgrade` doesn't remove the existing cert-manager issuer and certificates:

```
kubectl -n okteto annotate issuer okteto-okteto-enterprise helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
kubectl -n okteto annotate certificate default-ssl-certificate helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file to use the existing certificate:

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: default-ssl-certificate

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/default-ssl-certificate
```

> Keeping the same `issuer` and `certificate` reduces moving parts during the upgrade, but we recommend you to [bring your own certificate](/docs/enterprise/administration/certificates/) once the Okteto upgrade has been complete succesfully.

#### Upgrade Okteto

Run the following commands to upgrade your Okteto instance:

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm upgrade --install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto
```

#### After upgrade

Use `kubectl` to get the new address of the build service:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                           PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   a519c8b3b27f95...elb.amazonaws.com    1234:32449/TCP   5m
```

Update your DNS configuration with the `EXTERNAL-IP` address.

If you are [bringing your own certificates](/docs/enterprise/administration/certificates/), your Okteto instance is now fully upgraded. The rest of the guide doesn't apply to your configuration.

## Install cert-manager

Okteto will remove the instance of `cert-manager` that was installed by older versions of the helm chart. If you plan on using `cert-manager` as your certificate provider, you'll need to install it manually in your cluster using the instructions below: 
If this was the case, you need to install cert-manager to keep renewing your certificates. To do that, execute the following commands:

```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace=okteto --version=v1.5.2 --set global.podSecurityPolicy.enabled=true
```
