This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). We'll be focusing exclusively on GKE in order to keep it as simple as possible.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you will need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3
- A Google (or GitHub) OAuth application
- A Google Cloud service account and a key
- A Google Cloud Storage bucket
- An Okteto License (optional)

### Subdomain

You'll need access to a subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.

This guide will assume that your domain is registered in Google's [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns). Other DNS services can be used as well, but are not covered by this guide.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow Google's [GKE cluster creation guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster).
Okteto supports Kubernetes versions 1.21 through 1.23.

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.23
- A pool with at least 3 `n1-standard-4` nodes
- 250 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.
Run the following command to obtain your cluster's API server endpoint:

```
kubectl config view --minify | grep server
```

### Installing kubectl

Follow the official documentation for [installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to [talk to your new cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry).


### Installing Helm v3

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Creating the Google OAuth application

> Okteto supports OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, or OpenID Connect to handle user authentication. For this guide, we will focus on using Google. All the supported configuration settings [are described here](/docs/self-hosted/administration/configuration/#auth).

Follow Google's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth 2.0 Client](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

When creating the OAuth 2.0 Client, you will need to provide the following values:

**Authorized javascript origin**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

You'll use the `client ID` and `client Secret` when installing Okteto.

### Creating a Google Cloud Storage Bucket

Okteto uses Google Cloud Storage to store your private images. Follow Google's [guide on how to create storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstart-console). Create the bucket in the same project and region as your GKE cluster, and keep it private.

### Creating a Google Cloud Service Account

The Okteto Registry needs access to Cloud Storage for uploading and downloading your container images.

We recommend you follow Google's official documentation on [how to create and manage Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for more information on this.

You'll need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a `Service Account` in the same Google Cloud project as your GKE cluster.
1. Give it the `Storage Object Admin` roles.
1. Create a `JSON` key and save it locally. We'll be using this when installing Okteto.

## Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository in order to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

Okteto is free for up to 3 users without a license.
You can also sign on for the [free trial](/free-trial/) to give access up to 100 users for a month.

## Installing Okteto

### Create the Okteto Namespace

Run the following command to create a namespace to install Okteto in:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace okteto
```

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Create a Kubernetes secret with the `Service Account` key you created before:

```console
kubectl create secret generic okteto-cloud-secret --namespace=okteto --from-file=key=$PATH_TO_KEY_FILE
```

Download a copy of the [Okteto GKE configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/gke/config.yaml), open it, and set the following values:

- Your `email`
- Your `license` (optional)
- A `subdomain`
- `clientId` and `clientSecret` of the OAuth 2.0 Client you created
- Your cluster's API server endpoint
- The name of the `bucket` you created
- The `project` id of your cluster

For example:

```yaml
email: admin@example.com
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com

auth:
  google:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com
    clientSecret: clientSecret

cluster:
  endpoint: https://35.205.100.149

cloud:
  provider:
    gcp:
      enabled: true
      project: okteto-dev
      bucket: okteto-private-images

buildkit:
  ingress:
    enabled: false
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto
```

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the NGINX controller service External-IP:
- "*.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto

2. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the Buildkit service External-IP:
- "buildkit.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto

3. Once you create both DNS entries you can access your Okteto instance at this URL:
https://okteto.dev.example.com
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

We can use the instructions `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by GKE to the NGINX Ingress we've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    34.68.230.234   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. In Google Cloud DNS, this is done by creating an `A` record with the name  `*`. We also suggest you set the TTL to 1 minute.

### Retrieve the Buildkit IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by GKE to the Buildkit instance you've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   34.68.230.233    1234:32449/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. This is done by creating an `A` record with the name `buildkit`.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

> **Important**: The default installation uses self-signed certificates. We strongly recommend that you  configure Okteto to [bring your own certificates](/docs/self-hosted/administration/certificates/) before giving your team access to your instance.

You can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully log into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.
