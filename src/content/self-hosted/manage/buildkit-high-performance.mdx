# Configuring BuildKit for High Performance

Configuring BuildKit for high-performance is essential for a smooth development experience with Okteto.
Enhancing your BuildKit performance accelerates image builds, [test executions](testing/index.mdx) and deploy commands when using [Remote Execution](core/remote-execution.mdx).

## Dedicated Node Pool for Buildkit

Buildkit is resource-intensive.
We recommend deploying Buildkit in a dedicated node pool for optimal performance and to minimize the noise neighbor effect.

To deploy BuildKit on a dedicated build pool, you can add [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) to the BuildKit node pool in Kubernetes, and then add the following to your Okteto configuration:

```yaml
buildkit:
  nodeSelectors:
    okteto-node-pool: build
  tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: okteto-node-pool
      operator: Equal
      value: build
```      

## Scale Vertically: more CPUs means Faster Builds

Your BuildKit performance is significantly influenced by the CPU/Memory resources allocated to it.

We recommend scaling BuildKit vertically.
For example, start with 2 nodes with 4 CPUs and 16GB of memory each, and update the `replicaCount` of the [buildkit configuration section](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#buildkit) accordingly:

```yaml
buildkit:
  replicaCount: 2
```

Finally, monitor your BuildKit performance and node utilization with your favourite tool to adjust the BuildKit nodes vertically as needed.
For instance, upgrading your BuildKit nodes with 8 CPUs and 32 GB of memory each can provide approximately a 2x performance improvement 😎.

## Configure SSD Storage

Buildkit is I/O intensive, for example, to pull, extract and push your container images.
Using SSD storage can significantly improve your BuildKit performance.

```yaml
buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    class: ssd
```

You may also increase the size of the Buildkit cache to increase the number of BuildKit cache hits (default: 100 GB):

```yaml
buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 200Gi
```

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

[HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) enables the BuildKit pods to scale based on CPU and memory utilization, automatically adjusting pod numbers to meet demand.

#### Requirements
- The [Metrics API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-server) must be available in your cluster.
- Configure your BuildKit node pool in Kubernetes with autoscalability.

:::warning
The default Metrics API only works with `buildkit.rootless.enabled: true`. If you prefer not to enable BuildKit rootless mode, you will need to [configure your custom metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/#autoscaling-on-multiple-metrics-and-custom-metrics) in order for the HPA to behave correctly
:::

You can configure BuildKit HPA with the [buildkit.hpa](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#buildkit) configuration settings:

```yaml
buildkit:
  rootless:
    enabled: true
  hpa:
    enabled: true
    min: 2
    max: 6
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60    
```    

## Save Costs with Spot Instances

Leveraging spot instances can significantly reduce costs while providing the necessary compute resources for BuildKit.

:::tip
Configure at least 2 nodes for BuildKit, each one on a different zone, for high availability
:::

The Okteto CLI automatically retries any command if interrupted by BuildKit instance termination or failure to minimize the effect of using spot instances.
If using [remote execution](core/remote-execution.mdx), **it is very important to ensure that your deploy/test/destroy commands are idempotent**, as commands may run again if a node terminates during the execution of the deploy or destroy operations.

## Follow Dockerfile Best Practices

Even the best BuildKit setup cannot compensate for un-optimized Dockerfiles or inefficient [Remote Execution](core/remote-execution.mdx) configurations...
We have the following recommendations:

- Adhere to [Dockerfile best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/).
- Reduce file transfer times to BuildKit by using [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#dockerignore-file) and [.oktetoignore](core/remote-execution.mdx#ignoring-files) files.
- Use [buildkit cache mounts](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/) to persist cache folders between image builds. This can significantly speed up build times by caching dependencies and build artifacts.
- Use [Test Container caches](https://www.okteto.com/docs/reference/okteto-manifest/#caches-string-optional) to persist cache folders between test executions. This ensures that test dependencies are cached, reducing the time taken for subsequent test runs.
