# Configuring BuildKit for High Performance

Optimizing BuildKit performance is essential for a smooth development experience with Okteto.
A high-performance BuildKit setup accelerates image builds, [test executions](testing/index.mdx), and deploy commands when using [Remote Execution](core/remote-execution.mdx).

## 1. Dedicated Node Pool for BuildKit

BuildKit is resource-intensive.
We recommend deploying BuildKit in a dedicated node pool for optimal performance and to minimize interference from other workloads.

To deploy BuildKit on a dedicated build pool, you can add [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) to the BuildKit node pool in Kubernetes, and then add the following settings to your Okteto Helm configuration:

```yaml
buildkit:
  nodeSelectors:
    okteto-node-pool: build
  tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: okteto-node-pool
      operator: Equal
      value: build
```      

## 2. Scale Vertically: Increase CPUs for Faster Builds

BuildKit performance depends heavily on allocated CPU and memory resources.
Start with 2 nodes for higher availability, with the following recommended instance types (4 CPUs and 16GB RAM):

- Amazon Web Services: `m6a.xlarge`
- Google Cloud Platform: `t2d-standard-4`
- Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform: `Standard_D4as_v5`

Set the replicaCount to match the number of nodes in the BuildKit node pool:

```yaml
buildkit:
  replicaCount: 2
```

Monitor performance and adjust node resources as needed.
For instance, upgrading your BuildKit nodes to 8 CPUs and 32 GB of memory each can provide approximately a 2x performance improvement 😎.

## 3. Configure SSD Storage

BuildKit is I/O intensive, especially for pulling, extracting, and pushing container images.
Using a SSD storage class can significantly improve your BuildKit performance.

```yaml
buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    class: <<your-ssd-storage-class>>
```

You may also increase the size of the BuildKit cache to increase the number of BuildKit cache hits (default: 100 GB):

```yaml
buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 200Gi
```

## 4. Dedicated Load Balancer for BuildKit

By default, BuildKit is exposed via gRPC behind the [Okteto Nginx Ingress Controller](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#ingress-nginx).
This setup simplifies the initial installation, but we recommend exposing BuildKit on a dedicated load balancer for improved performance and control:

**Pros**
- More control over how build requests are distributed across BuildKit pods.
- Reduces load on the Nginx Ingress Controller, improving performance for other services.

**Cons**
- Extra costs for provisioning and maintaining an additional load balancer.

To expose BuildKit via a dedicated load balancer, add the following to your Okteto Helm configuration:

```yaml
buildkit:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  ingress:
    enabled: false
```      

:::info
Setting `sessionAffinity` to `ClientIP` directs all client requests to the same BuildKit pod, leveraging caching for improved performance.
Additional BuildKit service annotations might be needed to support `ClientIP` affinity, refer to your Cloud Provider documentation for additional assistance.
:::

After upgrading Okteto, use `kubectl` to retrieve the external IP address assigned to the BuildKit service:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/part-of=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                           PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   a519c8b3b27f95...elb.amazonaws.com    443:31597/TCP    5m
```

Take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address and create an `A` record for it with the name `buildkit.<<your-okteto-subdomain>>`.

## 5. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (optional)

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling ([HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)) enables the BuildKit pods to scale based on CPU and memory utilization, automatically adjusting pod numbers to meet demand.

#### Requirements
- The [Metrics API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-server) must be available in your cluster.
- Configure your BuildKit node pool in Kubernetes with autoscalability.

:::warning
The default Metrics API only works with `buildkit.rootless.enabled: true`. If you prefer not to enable BuildKit rootless mode, you will need to [configure your custom metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/#autoscaling-on-multiple-metrics-and-custom-metrics) in order for the HPA to behave correctly
:::

You can configure BuildKit HPA with the [buildkit.hpa](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#buildkit) configuration settings:

```yaml
buildkit:
  rootless:
    enabled: true
  hpa:
    enabled: true
    min: 2
    max: 6
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60    
```    

## 6. Save Costs with Spot Instances (optional)

Use spot instances to reduce costs while maintaining sufficient resources for BuildKit.

:::tip
Ensure high availability by configuring at least 2 nodes across different zones.
:::

The Okteto CLI automatically retries any command if interrupted by BuildKit instance termination or failure to minimize the effect of using spot instances.
If using [remote execution](core/remote-execution.mdx), **it is very important to ensure that your deploy/test/destroy commands are idempotent**, as commands may run again if a node terminates during the execution of the deploy or destroy operations.

## 7. Follow Best Practices for Dockerfiles and Remote Execution

Even the best BuildKit setup cannot compensate for un-optimized Dockerfiles or inefficient [Remote Execution](core/remote-execution.mdx) configurations.
To make the most of your BuildKit configuration, we have the following recommendations:

- Adhere to [Dockerfile best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/).
- Reduce file transfer times to BuildKit by using [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#dockerignore-file) and [.oktetoignore](core/remote-execution.mdx#ignoring-files) files.
- Use [BuildKit cache mounts](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/) to persist cache folders between image builds. This can significantly speed up build times by caching dependencies and build artifacts.
- Use [Test Container caches](https://www.okteto.com/docs/reference/okteto-manifest/#caches-string-optional) to persist cache folders between test executions. This ensures that test dependencies are cached, reducing the time taken for subsequent test runs.
