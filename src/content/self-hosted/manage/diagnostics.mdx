Okteto provides a diagnostics tool through the [Replicated Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh) framework. This tool is completely optional but can help troubleshoot complex issues, specially if you are getting assistance through Okteto Support.

Starting in Okteto 1.16, as part of the helm installation we deploy two configmaps in the okteto namespace that contain the specs to run preflights checks and create a support bundle. These configmaps are:

- `okteto-preflight`
- `okteto-support-bundle`

## Installation

You'll need to install the `kubectl` plugins:

```bash
kubectl krew install preflight
kubectl krew install support-bundle
```

More info about the installation [here](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/#installation).

# Preflight

Provides sanity checks for the okteto installation.

Simply run:

```
kubectl configmap get okteto-preflight -o yaml | kubectl preflight -n okteto -
```

This is a read-only interactive command that will provide a summary of the state of the cluster that is relevant to the okteto installation:


{/* TODO: Add GIF or image showing what this looks like */}


More info about preflight checks here: https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/preflight/introduction/

# Support bundle

Creates a gzipped tarball which includes cluster information, logs for okteto components, and other relevant information.

```
kubectl support-bundle \
  --interactive=false \
  --debug \
  -n okteto \
  -o okteto-support.tar.gz \
  --load-cluster-specs
```

This bundle can help troubleshoot issues with the cluster specially in an incident in which you are getting assistance from Okteto Support.
