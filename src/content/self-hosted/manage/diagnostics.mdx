Okteto provides a diagnostics tool through the [Replicated Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh) framework. This tool is completely optional but can help troubleshoot complex issues, specially if you are getting assistance through Okteto Support.

Starting in Okteto 1.16, as part of the helm installation we deploy a `okteto-support-bundle` configmaps in the okteto namespace that contain the specs to create a support bundle.

## Installation

You'll need to install the `kubectl` plugin:


```bash
kubectl krew install support-bundle
```

More info about the installation [here](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/#installation).

# Support bundle

Creates a gzipped tarball which includes cluster information, logs for okteto components, and other relevant information.

```
kubectl support-bundle \
  --interactive=false \
  --debug \
  -n okteto \
  -o okteto-support.tar.gz \
  --load-cluster-specs
```

This bundle can help troubleshoot issues with the cluster specially in an incident in which you are getting assistance from Okteto Support.
