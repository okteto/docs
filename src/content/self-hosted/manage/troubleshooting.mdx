## Understanding the state of your app: why endpoints aren't present in the CLI or UI

Endpoint links are not present within Okteto if there are no services actively running. Endpoint links are not present within Okteto if there are no services actively running. If your endpoints are missing, consider the following states and their implications:

#### Progressing: 
* Description: Your deployment is in the process of being rolled out
* Possible Causes:
  * Your service is still being started
  * There are pending updates or new deployments
* Actions:
  * Wait for the deployment to complete
  * Look at the events of the deployment for any issues

#### Running:
* Description: Your deployment is active, and the service should be running correctly
* Possible Causes:
  * The service is up, but there might be a configuration issue
  * The annotation for automatic ingress might be missing
  * Network policies or firewall rules could be blocking the endpoint
* Actions:
  * Verify the service annotations in your manifest to ensure `dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress: "true"` is present
  * Inspect network policies to confirm they allow traffic to your service

#### Error: 
* Description: There is an issue with your deployment preventing the service from running correctly
* Possible Causes:
  * Errors in the application code or container image
  * Misconfiguration in your service or deployment manifest
  * Insufficient resources or quota limits in the cluster
* Actions:
  * Check the logs
  * Validate the container image and configuration settings
  * Ensure that resource requests and limits are properly set and the cluster has enough capacity


## UPGRADE FAILED: “okteto” has no deployed releases

This error will occur on your second install/upgrade if your initial install failed. If the first instal failed, delete the existing install before trying again:

```
helm uninstall okteto
```

## Registry pods keep restarting

This can happen when the pods can't read/write from your cloud storage bucket. Double check that the cloud IAM you created has read/write access to the specified bucket.

## Deployment pipelines stay in "progressing" forever

This can happen for several reasons, among others, the installer job couldn't be started due to an error in Kubernetes API, or due to an overload in the cluster.
In order to find out what the problem is, there's a way to list all the jobs and pods for a specific pipeline.

You need the pipeline name (it is the name displayed on Okteto UI) and the namespace where it is deployed. With that information, you can get jobs and pods running these commands:

```console
kubectl get jobs -l=dev.okteto.com/pipeline-name=movies -l=dev.okteto.com/pipeline-namespace=cindy --namespace=okteto
```

```console
kubectl get pods -l=dev.okteto.com/pipeline-name=movies -l=dev.okteto.com/pipeline-namespace=cindy --namespace=okteto
```

## Using a Custom CNI

If you're using a custom CNI on your cluster then there may be some additional configuration needed for webhooks.
In certain cases the CNI used on the worker nodes is not the same as the CNI used by the control plane and host networking will need to be used for webhooks.
In addition, the ports may need to be changed to avoid collisions.

The Okteto Webhook is configured by setting`webhook.hostNetwork` to `true`. The ports are set with `webhook.port`.
More information on the Okteto Webhook configuration can be found [here](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#webhook).

## Docker Hub credentials misconfiguration

As you can [configure your own Docker Hub account](admin/dashboard.mdx#registry-credentials) in Okteto, it could happen that the credentials are not properly set. If that is the case, kubelet won't be able to pull public images from Docker Hub, which can be an important issue in the cluster.

If this ever happens in your cluster, there is a way to fix it:
- [Update the container image used by the daemonset pods](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#daemonset). **Important note**, use a container registry different than Docker Hub to pull the image without credential problems. For example, you can use `ghcr.io/okteto/busybox`.
- Change or remove the credentials for the Docker Hub registry.
- [Upgrade your cluster](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) with the new configuration.

After this, the Okteto daemonset will be able to configure the right credentials for Docker Hub. Once you verify everything is working, you can restore the original base image for the Okteto daemonset.
