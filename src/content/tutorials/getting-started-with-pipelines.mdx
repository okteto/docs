This tutorial provides a step by step guide to configure an [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest/).

## Overview

The tutorial is composed of the following steps:

- Step 1: Code the Hello World application
- Step 2: Define a Dockerfile for building the Docker image of the Hello World application
- Step 3: Create Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Hello World application on Okteto Cloud
- Step 4: Automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Manifest
- Step 5: Deployment time!

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Code the Hello World application

We will use a simple Hello World application to illustrate how to configure an Okteto Manifest.
The Hello World application is a simple web service that responds "Hello World!" to every request.
It's written in Go, but Okteto can be used with any application that runs on Kubernetes.

First, make a new directory called `hello-world` and move inside it:

```console
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
```

Create a new file under the name `main.go` with the following content:

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Starting hello-world server...")
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloServer)
    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}

func helloServer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello world!")
}
```

`main.go` implements a Golang web server that listens on port 8080 and responds to every Http request with the message *Hello world!*

Next, initialize your go module running the following command:

```console
$ go mod init go-getting-started
```

## Step 2: Define a Dockerfile for building the Docker image of the Hello World application

You need to build a Docker image and push it to a Docker registry before Okteto Cloud can run your application.

To do that, you need to define a `Dockerfile`.
A `Dockerfile` file is a sequence of instructions to build the Docker image of your application.
If you're not familiar with Docker, we strongly recommend you [learn about it](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker).

Open a new file under the name `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:buster

WORKDIR /app
ADD . .
RUN go build -o app

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

## Step 3: Create Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Hello World application on Okteto Cloud

To deploy an application to Okteto Cloud, you need to define it using Kubernetes manifests.

Let's start by creating a new folder for the Kubernetes manifests:

```console
$ mkdir k8s
```

When you use a Kubernetes manifest, you tell Kubernetes how you want your application to run. This time, you'll create a deployment object. Create a new file `k8s/deployment.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        image: okteto.dev/hello-world:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

The deployment manifest has three main sections:

- `metadata` defines the name for your deployment.
- `replicas` defines how many copies of it you want running.
- `template` tells Kubernetes what to deploy, and what labels to add. In this case, a single container, with the `okteto.dev/hello-world:latest` image we will build in our Okteto Pipeline, listening on port 8080, and with the `app: hello-world` label. Note that this label is the same used in the `selector` section.

> If you want to know more about Kubernetes deployment objects, check the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

You'll now need a way to access your application. You can expose an application on Kubernetes by creating a service object. Create a new file called `k8s/service.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-world
```

The service manifest has four main sections:

- `metadata` tells Kubernetes how to name your service
- `type` tells Kubernetes how you want to expose your service. In this case, it will expose it externally through a Load Balancer. In you want to **expose your application using ingress**, check the [docs](/docs/cloud/ssl/#bring-your-own-ingress).
- `ports` tells Kubernetes which ports you want to expose
- `selector` tells Kubernetes how to direct traffic. In this case, any pod with the `app: hello-world` label will receive traffic.

> Kubernetes manifests can get complex to manage. As your application grows, we recommend you pack your application using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

You now have everything ready to define the Okteto Manifest of the Hello World application.

> When writing your Kubernetes manifests, take into account the [multitenant Kubernetes restrictions](https://okteto.com/docs/cloud/multitenancy/) that we have in place to make Okteto Cloud a secure environment to run your applications.

## Step 4: Automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Manifest

You can automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Manifest to provide a one-click deployment experience for anyone in your team or your open source community.
To define your Okteto Manifest, create a new file `okteto.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
build:
  hello-world:
     image: okteto.dev/hello-world:latest
     context: .
     dockerfile: Dockerfile
deploy:
  - kubectl apply -f k8s
```

The Okteto Manifest has a `build` section to define how to build the image of my application.

The Okteto Manifest also has a `deploy` section to define the sequence of commands to deploy the Hello World application.
In this case, it deploys the Hello World application using `kubectl` and the Kubernetes manifests you created on Step 2.

You can make use of tools such as `kubectl`, `helm`, `okteto`, and `kustomize` in your `deploy` commands.

## Step 5: Deployment time!

In order to deploy the application, you just need to run `okteto deploy`.
