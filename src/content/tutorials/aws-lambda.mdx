This tutorial will show you how to deploy a development environment in Okteto that contains an AWS Lambda function with Okteto.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Okteto instance
- Access to an AWS account with the permissions to create IAMs

## Step 1: Create an IAM user

The IAM user that you use with AWS SAM must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources. 

The following permissions will enable you to complete this tutorial:
- AWSCloudFormationFullAccess
- IAMFullAccess
- AWSLambda_FullAccess
- AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator
- AmazonS3FullAccess

Once the user has been created, [generate a set of access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html), and save them file locally.

In order for the installer to be able to use this keys, we need to add them as [Okteto Variables](manifest/okteto-variables.mdx). Use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` as the name for the variable that contains the access ID, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as the name for the variable that contains the access key.

You can add them as [User Variables](manifest/okteto-variables.mdx), or [Admin Variables](admin/dashboard.mdx#variables) if you want everyone in your Okteto instance to be able to use them.

## Step 2: Define a Docker image that includes your tools and dependencies

We are going to use the SAM CLI to build and deploy our AWS Lambda function. [SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications in AWS.

You could install the SAM CLI directly in your workstation and then deploy the function. But then, anyone who wants to deploy this application would need to have it installed as well. Instead, we recommend creating a Docker image with the `awscli`, `sam`, and any other tool you might need to be preinstalled on it. This way, Okteto takes care of all the dependencies for your entire team, and you can focus on shipping great features. You can [learn more about this here](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy-remotely).

To do this, first create a Dockerfile:

```
# Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-buster

RUN apt-get update && \ 
  apt-get install -y unzip curl && \
  curl -o /tmp/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip -L https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip && \
  unzip /tmp/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip -d /tmp/aws-cli && \
  sh /tmp/aws-cli/aws/install && \
  aws --version && \
  curl -o /tmp/aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip -L https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/latest/download/aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip && \
  unzip /tmp/aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip -d /tmp/sam-installation && \
  sh /tmp/sam-installation/install && \
  sam --version

```

Then [add a `build` section](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#build-object-optional) to your Okteto manifest to tell Okteto to build the image on demand when deploying your development environment:

```
#okteto.yaml
# okteto.yaml
build:
  sam:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

## Step 3: Create your Okteto manifest

This tutorial will only deploy the AWS Lambda function to keep it simple. In the real world, you'd typically include containers and AWS Lambda functions as part of your Development Environment. 

To deploy a function in Okteto, you need to create an Okteto manifest similar to the one below:

```yaml
# okteto.yaml
build:
  sam:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
deploy:
  image: ${OKTETO_BUILD_SAM_IMAGE}
  commands:
    - name: build function
      command: sam build
    - name: deploy function
      command: |
        sam deploy --no-confirm-changeset --no-fail-on-empty-changeset --s3-prefix "${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}" --stack-name "${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}-okteto-lambda" --resolve-s3
        FUNCTION_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region us-east-1 --stack-name ${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}-okteto-lambda --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue" --output text)
        
        # use external resources to display the URL the Okteto UI
        echo "OKTETO_EXTERNAL_LAMBDA_ENDPOINTS_FUNCTION_URL=$FUNCTION_URL" >> $OKTETO_ENV
destroy:
  image: ${OKTETO_BUILD_SAM_IMAGE}
  commands:
  - name: destroy function
    command: sam delete --no-prompts --stack-name "${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}-okteto-lambda" --region us-east-1
external:
  lambda:
    icon: function
    endpoints:
    - name: function
```

:::info
This manifest takes advantage of our [External Resources](manifest/external-resources.mdx) feature to manage the lifecycle of external resources as part of your Okteto development environment. [Learn more about External Resources here](manifest/external-resources.mdx).
:::

Details:
- The `deploy.image` field tells Okteto to use the image we defined on the `build` section.
- The `deploy.commands` section includes all the commands needed to build and deploy the function. 
- The `destroy` section includes the commands to destroy the Lambda function. This will be invoked when the environment or the namespace is destroyed. 

## Step 4: Deploy your Development Environment

Deploy your Development Environment by running the following command:

```bash
okteto deploy
```

After a few seconds, your Development Environment will be fully deployed and your AWS Lambda function will be up and running. Every time you redeploy the Development Environment, the AWS Lambda function will be recreated with your latest code.

The source code used in this tutorial [is available here](https://github.com/okteto/aws-lambda).

## Next steps

Congratulations, you just deployed **your first AWS Lambda function in Okteto** ðŸš€.
