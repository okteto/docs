## Key Features

### Development Environments
Okteto's [Development Environments](deploy/development-environments.mdx) enable you to deploy and develop applications directly in the cloud with a single [CLI command](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx). Write code locally on your machine and view your changes live, deployed in a managed Kubernetes cluster **as soon as you hit save**! You don't have to spend time configuring anything to do this.

### Automated Preview Environments
Collaborate and share your progress with ease. Okteto's [Preview Environments](preview/overview.mdx) automatically generate a unique, shareable version of your application for each pull request, making code reviews and stakeholder feedback a breeze.

### Unified management interface
Manage your team's development environments, applications, workflows, and roles all from Okteto's [Admin Dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx). This central hub provides visibility and control over your team's cloud-native development processes, making management straightforward and efficient.
