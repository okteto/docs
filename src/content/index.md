Okteto is a platform that simplifies the process of deploying development environments in Kubernetes without requiring the expertise to do this yourself. This enables developers to automatically spin up fully-managed development environments that emulate production as closely as possible. Okteto eliminates the friction of local development environments, the many deviations that can exist for the same engineering organization, and the troubleshooting that comes with them.

This overview covers what Okteto offers and how you can get started.

## Development Environments
[Development Environments](deploy/development-environments.mdx) enable you to deploy and develop applications in Kubernetes with a joyful development experience. Developers write code locally on their machine but they can view their changes live, deployed in a Kubernetes cluster **as soon as they hit save**! You don't have to spend time configuring anything to do this. Okteto takes care of it all for you. We also have more detailed documentation about development environments available [here](deploy/development-environments.mdx).

## Preview Environments
Using Okteto, you can configure [Preview Environments](preview/overview.mdx) for your code repositories. Every pull request will be deployed and will generate its own sharable URL. This helps teams browse the changes in a pull request before it gets merged without having to take care of any deployment-related setup. These URLs can also be shared with other stakeholders so the review process isn't just limited to developers.

## Why Okteto?

Okteto was built for developers, by developers. We understand how frustrating it is to deal with the modern-day challenges of cloud-native development.

Seeing what you're developing, deployed in a realistic production-like environment, while you're still actively writing the code is a problem multiple tools try to solve, but none are as effective as Okteto. We know that developers want to focus on writing code, not setting up or troubleshooting environments. We abstract away the complexities of developing on Kubernetes to give developers the freedom they love. Developers can focus on writing code and Okteto takes care of setting up and managing the development infrastructure.
