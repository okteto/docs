- **Okteto Manifest simplifies environment automation**: Utilize the [Okteto Manifest](core/okteto-manifest.mdx) to define and configure your development environments declaratively. This powerful feature ensures consistent and reproducible environments across your team, tailored to your projects' needs. Use the [Okteto Catalog](development/deploy/deploy-from-catalog.mdx) to create a collection of ready-to-use development environments for your development team.

## Key Features

### Development Environments
Okteto's [Development Environments](development/index.mdx) enable you to deploy and develop applications directly in the cloud with a single [CLI command](development/using-okteto-cli.mdx) or click of a button. Write code locally on your machine and view your changes live, deployed in the cloud **as soon as you hit save**! You don't have to spend time configuring anything to do this.

### Automated Preview Environments
Collaborate and share your progress with ease. Okteto's [Preview Environments](previews/index.mdx) automatically generate a unique, shareable version of your application for each pull request, making code reviews, automated end-to-end testing, and stakeholder feedback a breeze.

### Unified management interface
Manage your team's development environments, applications, workflows, and roles all from Okteto's [Admin Dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx). This central hub provides visibility and control over your team's cloud-native development processes, making management straightforward and efficient.
