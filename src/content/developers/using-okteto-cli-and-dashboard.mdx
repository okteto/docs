The Okteto CLI is our [open-source](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) tool that let's you develop your applications on Okteto.
If you haven't done so yet, install and configure the Okteto CLI following [this guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx).

Most developer interact with okteto via the Command Line Interface (CLI). Here we‚Äôll explain common CLI commands and a typical workflow using them.

## Essential Okteto CLI Commands

## Overview of the Okteto Dashboard

1. **Your Personal Namespace**

   - Automatically generated for each user, this Namespace is uniquely named after the user's username or email, ensuring a personalized environment. These cannot be deleted, but their resources can be destroyed allowing the Namespace to be reused

2. **Using the Catalog to Deploy a Development Environment**

   ![Screenshot 2024-07-17 at 10.21.04‚ÄØPM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1bd795a3-7364-48dd-8ecc-d7a1e4cab9d0/f9132257-47f3-4cc9-ab98-e0d56f83df84/Screenshot_2024-07-17_at_10.21.04_PM.png)

   The most common way to deploy a Development Environment on Okteto is through the Catalog. The Catalog is a list of your applications, configured by a platform engineer on your team, with everything they need to run included. You can find the Catalog by clocking on the ‚ÄúDeploy a Dev Environment‚Äù button.

   You can also deploy a Development Environment with the following methods:

   - **Git Repository:** Deploy from a repository in a connected GitHub account
   - **URL**: Deploy from a specific Git URL

3. **Creating a New Namespace**
   - **Non-Personal Namespaces** are additional Namespaces created by users or through automation, facilitating broader project collaboration and management. They may be deleted or transferred to other users.
   - As a common practice, you might name your Namespace based on a feature number, ticket number, or a similar identifier. Development environments within these Namespaces are created from Git branches. This allows you to run multiple Namespaces simultaneously, each corresponding to a different branch or feature.
4. [**Sharing a Namespace**](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/namespaces/#sharing-and-collaboration-with-namespaces)

   - Collaborate on several applications at once by sharing your namespace
   - To share a Namespace go to the Okteto dashboard, select the namespace you want to share and press the `Share` button in the namespace menu (you'll find it in the main bar at the top).

5. **Environment States**
   - **Sleep**: Suspend your environment to save resources, the Okteto Garbage collector configured by your Okteto admin will set the sleep periods
   - **Destroy All**: Remove all resources in a Namespace
   - **Keep Awake**: Admins can choose to prevent Namespaces from sleeping so that they are always accessible
6. **Preview Environments**

   - Temporary environments for testing features before merging into the main branch. These are a great way to share your changes with a QA Team or Product Manager
   - Okteto Admins can configure Previews to work with your source control and CI/CD provider so that a Preview links are automatically added to submitted pull requests

### Common Workflows

- When do I create a Namespace?
- **Deploying Your App**
  - Use `okteto deploy` to deploy your application using your local code
  - Explain catalog option
- **Managing Environments**
  - Use `okteto up` to start your Development Container and connect your local machine
  - Use `okteto down` to stop your Development Container
  - Use `okteto namespace` to switch between different Namespaces
  - Use `okteto destroy` to completely destroy a deployed Development Environment. Note that this does not destroy the persistent volumes that were created for that environment, if you want it to do that you need to pass the `-v` flag
- **Other Useful Commands**
  - `okteto logs`: View logs of your application
  - `okteto doctor`: Diagnose issues with your Development Containers
  - `okteto endpoints`: List the endpoints of your deployed application

Now that you know more about the Okteto CLI, let's introduce the concept of [Development Containers](development/containers/index.mdx) üòé
