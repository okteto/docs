This guide explains how to onboard your own applications to Okteto.
To do that, you will follow a step by step process to create your first [Okteto Manifest](manifest/overview-manifest.mdx).
The steps to create your first Okteto Manifest are:

- Deploy your application in a Development Environment
- Add dependencies to your Development Environment
- Expose your application using Okteto Endpoints
- Build your container images with Okteto Build
- Configure a Development Container to iterate on your app

## Requirements

Before you start this step-by-step tutorial, make sure you accomplished the following requirements:

- You have access to an Okteto instance. [Sign up for our free 30 days trial](https://www.okteto.com/free-trial/) to start the process
- You have [installed the Okteto CLI](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx/#installing-the-okteto-cli) and [configured the Okteto CLI](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx/#configuring-the-okteto-cli) with your Okteto instance
- You have completed our [getting started guide](get-started/deploy-first-env.mdx) and understand the basics of the Okteto development experience


Now let's start by cleaning your namespace with the following command:

```console
$ okteto destroy -v --all
```

This is important to make sure there is no orphaned resources from previous samples.

Once this command finishes, you are ready to [start the tutorial](onboard-your-app/deploy.mdx) and create your first Okteto Manifest!
