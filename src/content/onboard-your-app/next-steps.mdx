Congratulations! You successfully onboarded your first application to Okteto ðŸš€

Okteto lets you develop your applications directly on Kubernetes. This way you can:

- Accelerate the onboarding of new developers by reducing local setup dependencies
- Eliminate integration issues by developing on a production-like environment running on Kubernetes
- Test your application end to end as fast as you type code with Development Containers
- No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Develop at the speed of the cloud!

From here, we recommend:

- Check our samples for [ASP.NET](guides/samples/aspnetcore.mdx), [Go](guides/samples/golang.mdx), [Java](guides/samples/java.mdx), [Node.js](guides/samples/node.mdx), [PHP](guides/samples/php.mdx), [Python](guides/samples/python.mdx) or [Ruby](guides/samples/ruby.mdx) to configure Development Containers for different programming languages
- Read about [Preview Environments](preview/overview.mdx) to use Okteto to share, test and validate your changes on CI
