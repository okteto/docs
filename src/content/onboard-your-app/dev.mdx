In this step we you configure a Development Container to iterate on your app and fix a bug.

To configure a Development Container for the **api** Kubernetes Deployment, add the following section to your `okteto.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev:
  api:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - api:/src
    forward:
      - 9229:9229
```

The `api` key matches the name of the **api** Kubernetes Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:

- `command`: the start command of the Development Container.
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the Development Container.
- `forward`: a list of ports to forward from your Development Container to localhost in your machine. This is needed to configure the Node debugger.

You can fine tune the synchronization protocol by adding a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your Development Container.
For example, in this case you add add a `.stignore` file with this content in the `api` subfolder:

```
.git
/node_modules
```

This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, git metadata, or dependencies like the `node_modules` folder.

Next, execute the following command to activate your Development Container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 âœ“  Persistent volume successfully attached
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Context:   okteto.example.com
    Namespace: cindylopezlopez
    Name:      api
    Forward:   9229 -> 9229

yarn run v1.22.19
$ nodemon server.js
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Visiting the frontend endpoint for the Movies app, something doesn't look right here, does it?

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

The list of movies is the same as Cindy's continue watching list. Let's fix that.

Open your local IDE and edit line 43 in `/api/server.js` to:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Now save your changes. Okteto will automatically synchronize your changes to your Development Container.
Take a look at your shell and notice how the changes are detected by [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

You can see your changes by simply refreshing the browser:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies-fixed.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

This feedback loop is incredible fast and saves a lot of of time while you are developing ðŸš€

Finaly, it's time to summarize what you have accomplished on this guide and define the [Next Steps](onboard-your-app/next-steps.mdx) in your Okteto journey!
