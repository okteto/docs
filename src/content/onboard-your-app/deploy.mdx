For this tutorial, you will be using a variation of our Movies app, but removing all the Okteto specific configuration first.

Start by cloning Movies app repo:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-onboard
$ cd movies-onboard
```

> The branch `onboarded` of the https://github.com/okteto/movies-onboard repo contains all the changes you will be doing through this tutorial. It can be useful to visualize all the changes you finish the tutorial.

The Movies app comes with a Helm chart to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
To instruct Okteto to deploy this application, create an `okteto.yaml` file at the root of the repo with the following content:

```yaml
deploy:
  commands:
    - name: Helm Install
      command: helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

Now deploy your app with Okteto running `okteto deploy`:

```console
$ okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindylopez @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindylopez
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  There are no available endpoints for 'movies-onboard'.
    Follow this link to know more about how to create public endpoints for your application:
    https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/ingress/automatic-ssl
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies-onboard' successfully deployed
```

Check that you app is up un running by login into the Okteto UI:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/movies-onboard-deploy-ui.png").default}
  alt="Movies Onboard Deploy"
  width="850"
/>

Or by configuring your Kubernetes credentials to access your Okteto Namespace:

```console
$ okteto kubeconfig
```

```
Updated kubernetes context 'okteto_example_com/cindylopez' in '[/Users/cindylopez/.kube/config]'
```

And using `kubectl` to visualize your Okteto Namespace:

```console
$ kubectl get all
```

```

Awesome, you have deployed your first Development Environment ðŸš€

But note that the Okteto CLI is informing that `There are no available endpoints for 'movies-onboard'`.

Let's fix that in the [next step](onboard-your-app/endpoints.mdx) of this guide!
