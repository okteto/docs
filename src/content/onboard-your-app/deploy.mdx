We will be using our Movies App as a sample, but removing all the Okteto configuration first.

Start by forking the Movies App repo:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
$ cd movies-with-helm
```

and checkout the `onboard-your-app` branch:
```console
$ git checkout onboard-your-app
```

The Movies App comes with a Helm chart to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
You can use any other tool to deploy your application with Okteto. The process to do that would be quite similar to the process followed in this guide.

To instruct Okteto to deploy this application, create an `okteto.yml` file at the root of the repo with the following content:

```yaml
deploy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - name: Helm Install
      command: helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

Now you are ready to deploy your app with Okteto running `okteto deploy`:

```console
$ okteto deploy
```

```console
