Docker Compose are for developers who don't want to deal with the complexities of Kubernetes manifests.
Okteto implements and extends the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) to make it easy to develop Docker Compose applications in Kubernetes.

## Example

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    command: python app.py
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - ./vote:/src

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

volumes:
  redis:
```

The equivalent Kubernetes manifests would have more than 300 lines of yaml!

## Schema reference

### services ([object], optional)

Define the services that make up your Docker Compose application.

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data
```

Each service supports the fields in the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).
We summarize the most relevant ones below:

#### build ([string|object], optional)

Indicate how to build the image of this service when running `okteto build` or `okteto deploy --build`.
The value is the path to the build context:

```yaml
build: vote
```

It can also be an object with these fields:

- `context`: the build context. When the value supplied is a relative path, it is interpreted as relative to the location of the Docker Compose file (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It is a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the multi-stage build [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
  target: prod
  args:
    - ENV1=prod
    - ENV2=$VALUE
```

`okteto deploy` builds a new docker image, pushes it to the registry and redeploys your containers.

#### cap_add ([string], optional)

Add container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_add:
  - ALL
```

#### cap_drop ([string], optional)

Drop container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_drop:
  - NET_ADMIN
  - SYS_ADMIN
```

#### command (string, optional)

Override the default command of the container image `CMD`.

```yaml
command: --debug
```

`command` can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
command: ["-p", "3000"]
```

#### depends_on ([string]|object, optional)

Specify the conditions that the declared services must meet in order for the service to start. The condition must be one of the following:

- `service_started`: Wait until the service is running.
- `service_healthy`: Wait for one of the ports of the dependent service to be available.
- `service_completed_successfully`: Wait until the dependent service has been successfully completed.

```yaml
depends_on:
  app:
    condition: service_started
  db:
    condition: service_healthy
  initialization-svc:
    condition: service_completed_successfully
```

You can also express dependencies as a list of services. In this case it will be the same as setting the condition to `service_started`.

```yaml
depends_on:
  - app
  - db
  - initialization-svc
```

#### entrypoint (string, optional)

Override the default entrypoint of the container image `ENTRYPOINT`.

```yaml
entrypoint: yarn start
```

The entrypoint can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
entrypoint: ["yarn", "start"]
```

#### env_file (string, optional)

Add environment variables from a file to the containers of a service.
Environment variables declared in the [environment section](reference/docker-compose.mdx#environment-string-optional) override these values.
This also holds true if those values are empty or undefined.

```yaml
env_file: .env
```

`env_file` also accepts a list of files:

```yaml
env_file:
  - .env.frontend
  - .env.api
```

#### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  DEV_MODE: yes
  DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
```

#### healthcheck (object, optional)

healthcheck declares a check that's run to determine whether or not containers for a
service are "healthy".

- `start_period` (duration): Time between the start of the container and the initiation of the healthcheck.
- `interval` (duration): Time between a healthcheck and a subsequent new try.
- `timeout` (duration): Number of seconds after which the healthcheck times out.
- `retries` (int): Number of retries before healthcheck fails.
- `test` (string): Defines the command that will be run to check the container's health. It can be
either a string or a list. If it's a list, the first item must be either `NONE`, `CMD` or `CMD-SHELL`.
If it's a string, it's equivalent to specifying `CMD-SHELL` followed by that string.
- `http` (object): Defines the path and port that has to be tested on the container to set
 the healthcheck as successful
- `x-okteto-readiness` (bool): Defines if the probe should be a readiness probe (default: `true`).
- `x-okteto-liveness` (bool): Defines if the probe should be a liveness probe (default: `false`).

```yaml
healthcheck:
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 10m
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
  http:
    path: /
    port: 8080
```

Healthchecks can also test a command as follows:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 10m
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
  test: echo 'db.runCommand({serverStatus:1}).ok' | mongo admin -u $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME -p $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD --quiet | grep 1
```

#### image (string, optional)

The container image of each service.

```yaml
image: okteto/vote:compose
```

If [`build`](reference/docker-compose.mdx#build-stringobject-optional) is defined, `image` is optional. Otherwise, it's required.

#### labels ([string], optional)

Specify labels for the service. They translates to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: sample
```

You can set the update policy of a service by setting the label `dev.okteto.com/update`.

Depending on the kind of resource the acceptance values are different:
- rolling:  Will deploy a service with zero downtime. Only allowed for deployments and stateful sets.
- recreate: Will wait until the current pod is deleted to start creating the new one. Only allowed on deployments.
- on-delete: Will wait until the current pod is deleted to start creating the new one. Only allowed on stateful sets.

```yaml
services:
  deployment:
    image: python:alpine
    labels:
      "dev.okteto.com/update": rolling
    entrypoint: python -m http.server 8080
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
  sfs:
    image: python:alpine
    labels:
      "dev.okteto.com/update": on-delete
    entrypoint: python -m http.server 8080
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
    - /usr/src
```

:::info
Remember that Docker Compose labels are translated into Kubernetes annotations.
:::

#### ports ([int], optional)

Ports exposed by each service. By default, they're only accessible from the cluster private network.

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080
```

To make the port public, use the following notation:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
```

If you need to configure HTTPS routes, use [endpoints](reference/docker-compose.mdx#endpoints-object-optional) instead of configuring an NGINX container in your Docker Compose file.

The following ports are never made public:

| Protocol        | Port                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| MySQL           | 3306                    |
| OracleDB        | 1521,1830               |
| PostgreSQL      | 5432                    |
| SQL Server      | 1433,1434               |
| MaxDB           | 7210                    |
| Neo4j           | 7473                    |
| ArangoDB        | 8529                    |
| Cassandra       | 7000,7001,9042          |
| InfluxDB        | 8086                    |
| Elasticsearch   | 9200,9300               |
| CouchDB         | 5984                    |
| MongoDB         | 27017,27018,27019,28017 |
| Redis           | 6379                    |
| Riak            | 8087,8088               |
| RethinkDB       | 828015,29015,28015      |
| Solr            | 7574,8983               |
| Golang debugger | 2345                    |
| Node debugger   | 5858,9229               |
| Java debugger   | 5005                    |
| Ruby debugger   | 1234                    |
| Python debugger | 4444,5678               |

If you need make these ports public, you can use [endpoints](reference/docker-compose.mdx#endpoints-object-optional).

#### resources (object, optional)

Configure resource [requests and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 300m
    memory: 500Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 800Mi
```

Or with the [docker-compose v3 configuration](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#resources).

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      cpus: 500m
      memory: 800Mi
    limits:
      cpus: 300m
      memory: 500Mi
```

#### restart (string, optional)

Defines the policy that the platform will apply on container termination.

- `always/unless-stopped/any`: The default restart policy. The policy always restarts the container until its removal.
- `none/never/no`: The policy does not restart a container under any circumstances.
- `on-failure`: The policy restarts a container if the exit code indicates an error.

```yaml
deploy:
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    max_attempts: 3
```

If the restart policy is other than always, the service will be translated to a Kubernetes Job.

#### scale (int, optional)

Specify the number of containers running for each service (default: `1`).

```yaml
scale: 2
```

#### stop_grace_period (duration|int, optional)

Specify how long to wait when attempting to stop a container before sending SIGKILL.
If no unit of time is given, the system will interpret the number in seconds.

`stop_grace_period` translates to the `terminationGracePeriod` setting in the pod.

```yaml
stop_grace_period: 10s
```

#### volumes ([string], optional)

Define volumes accessible by the containers of a service at a given path.

```yaml
volumes:
  - redis:/data
```

The volume `redis` must be defined in the [volumes section](reference/docker-compose.mdx#volumes-object-optional).

The following notation is also accepted:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /data
```

Finally, host volumes are also supported:

```yaml
volumes:
  - .:/usr/app/src
```

Host volumes are ignored at deployment time if the service defines a `build` section. Otherwise, they are added to the content of the `image` defined by the service.

`okteto up` uses host volumes to infer the [sync paths](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#sync-string-required) between your local filesystem and your remote development container.

By default, services mounting the same volume will be placed on the same node using Kubernetes's pod affinity. If you wish to disable this behavior, set the environment variable `OKTETO_COMPOSE_VOLUME_AFFINITY_ENABLED` to `false` when deploying. You can also optionally configure this variable from the Okteto UI to make it available to all development environments in your namespace.

#### working_dir (string, optional)

Override the default working directory of the container image `WORKDIR`.

```yaml
working_dir: "/app/code"
```

#### x-node-selector (map[string]string, optional)

List of labels that the node must have to include the service containers on it.

```yaml
x-node-selector:
  disktype: ssd
```

More information about Kubernetes node selectors is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

### volumes ([object], optional)

List of volumes created by the Docker Compose file.
Volumes are mounted on the containers of a given service by referring the volume from the [volumes field](reference/docker-compose.mdx#volumes-string-optional) of the service.

```yaml
volumes:
  redis:
    driver_opts:
      size: 1Gi
```

Each volume has the following properties:

#### driver_opts.class (string, optional)

Specify the storage class of the volume.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  class: standard
```

#### driver_opts.size (string, optional)

Specify the size of the volume. Defaults to 1Gi.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  size: 1Gi
```

#### labels (string, optional)

Specify labels for the volume. They will translate to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: redis
```

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of Docker Compose files that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Environment variable substitution

It’s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: "app:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in your Docker Compose file in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the Docker Compose file.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat docker-compose.yml
services:
   web:
      image: "app:${TAG}"
```

When you run `okteto deploy` the `web` container uses the image `app:v1.5`.

:::note

Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.

:::

### extensions (object, optional)

Specifies a configuration that can be used in other services using anchors.
Every top-level field starting with the prefix 'x-' will be interpreted as an extension.

```yaml
x-function: &environment
  environment:
    DEV_MODE: yes
    DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
services:
  app:
    <<: *environment
    image: okteto.dev/example
```

### Okteto Variables

You can also use your [Okteto Variables](core/okteto-variables.mdx) in your Docker Compose file.

For example, if your have an Okteto Variable named `PASSWORD` whose value is `change-me!`, the following Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}
```

will use `change-me!` for the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable of the `mysql` service when you run `okteto deploy`.

:::note

Values in the shell and/or the `.env` file take precedence over those specified as Okteto Variables.

:::

## Okteto makes Docker Compose even more powerful!

Okteto extends the Compose Specification to make it even easier for you and your team to build cloud-native applications.

### endpoints ([object], optional)

Endpoints expose HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
Use this instead of having to run a NGINX proxy in your Docker Compose file.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - path: /
    service: frontend
    port: 80
  - path: /api
    service: api
    port: 8080
```

The endpoint uses the name of the development environment to generate a URL with the following format: https://NAME-NAMESPACE.okteto.example.com.

Each endpoint has the following properties:

#### path (string, required)

The request path that will handle this route.

#### service (string, required)

The service that will receive the request.

#### port (int, required)

The port that will receive the request.

If more than one endpoint is needed, you can declare multiple endpoints by using a map with the name of the endpoint and its specification:

```yaml
endpoints:
  landing:
    - path: /
      service: nginx
      port: 80
  web:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 80
    - path: /api
      service: api
      port: 8080
```

In this case, the URLs `landing-NAMESPACE.okteto.example.com` and `web-NAMESPACE.okteto.example.com` are created.

`endpoints` also accepts an extended notation to specify labels for each endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  rules:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 3000
    - path: /api
      service: backend
      port: 8080
```
