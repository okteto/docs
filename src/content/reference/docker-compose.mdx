Docker Compose are for developers who don't want to deal with the complexities of Kubernetes manifests.
Okteto implements and extends the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) to make it easy to develop Docker Compose applications in Kubernetes.

## Example

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    command: python app.py
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - ./vote:/src

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

volumes:
  redis:
```

The equivalent Kubernetes manifests would have more than 300 lines of yaml!

## Schema reference

### services ([object], optional)

Define the services that make up your Docker Compose application.

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data
```

Each service supports the fields in the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).
We summarize the most relevant ones below:

#### build ([string|object], optional)

Indicate how to build the image of this service when running `okteto build` or `okteto deploy --build`.
The value is the path to the build context:

```yaml
build: vote
```

It can also be an object with these fields:

- `context`: the build context. When the value supplied is a relative path, it is interpreted as relative to the location of the Docker Compose file (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It is a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the multi-stage build [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.
- `export_cache`: image tag for exported cache when build.
- `cache_from`: list of images to import cache from.

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
  target: prod
  args:
    - ENV1=prod
    - ENV2=$VALUE
```

`okteto deploy --build` builds a new docker image, pushes it to the registry and redeploys your containers.
By default, it builds the images using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/cloud/build/). Set the variable `BUILDKIT_HOST` if you want to use your own BuildKit instance.

#### cap_add ([string], optional)

Add container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_add:
  - ALL
```

#### cap_drop ([string], optional)

Drop container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_drop:
  - NET_ADMIN
  - SYS_ADMIN
```

#### command (string, optional)

Override the default command of the container image `CMD`.

```yaml
command: --debug
```

`command` can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
command: ["-p", "3000"]
```

#### depends_on ([string]|object, optional)

Specify the conditions that the declared services must meet in order for the service to start. The condition must be one of the following:

- `service_started`: Wait until the service is running.
- `service_healthy`: Wait for one of the ports of the dependent service to be available.
- `service_completed_successfully`: Wait until the dependent service has been successfully completed.

```yaml
depends_on:
  app:
    condition: service_started
  db:
    condition: service_healthy
  initialization-svc:
    condition: service_completed_successfully
```

You can also express dependencies as a list of services. In this case it will be the same as setting the condition to `service_started`.

```yaml
depends_on:
  - app
  - db
  - initialization-svc
```

#### entrypoint (string, optional)

Override the default entrypoint of the container image `ENTRYPOINT`.

```yaml
entrypoint: yarn start
```

The entrypoint can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
entrypoint: ["yarn", "start"]
```

#### env_file (string, optional)

Add environment variables from a file to the containers of a service.
Environment variables declared in the [environment section](/docs/reference/compose/#environment-string-required) override these values.
This also holds true if those values are empty or undefined.

```yaml
env_file: .env
```

`env_file` also accepts a list of files:

```yaml
env_file:
  - .env.frontend
  - .env.api
```

#### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  DEV_MODE: yes
  DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
```

#### healthcheck (object, optional)

healthcheck declares a check that's run to determine whether or not containers for a
service are "healthy". 

- `start_period` (duration): Time between the start of the container and the initiation of the healthcheck.
- `interval` (duration): Time between a failed healthcheck and a subsequent new try.
- `timeout` (duration): Number of seconds after which the healthcheck times out. 
- `retries` (int): Number of retries before the healthcheck fails.
- `test` (string): defines the command the Compose implementation will run to check container health. It can be
either a string or a list. If it's a list, the first item must be either NONE, CMD or CMD-SHELL.
If it's a string, it's equivalent to specifying CMD-SHELL followed by that string.

```yaml
healthcheck:
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 10m
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
  test: curl https://0.0.0.0:8080/readiness
```

Http healthchecks can be defined as follows:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 10m
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
  http:
    path: /
    port: 8080
```

#### image (string, optional)

The container image of each service.

```yaml
image: okteto/vote:compose
```

If [`build`](/docs/reference/compose/#build-stringobject-optional) is defined, `image` is optional. Otherwise, it's required.

#### labels ([string], optional)

Specify labels for the service. They translates to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: sample
```

#### ports ([int], optional)

Ports exposed by each service. By default, they're only accessible from the cluster private network.

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080
```

To make the port public, use the following notation:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
```

In you need need to configure HTTPS routes, use [endpoints](/docs/reference/compose/#endpoints-object-optional) instead of configuring an NGINX container in your Docker Compose file.

The following ports are never made public:

| Protocol        | Port                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| MySQL           | 3306                    |
| OracleDB        | 1521,1830               |
| PostgreSQL      | 5432                    |
| SQL Server      | 1433,1434               |
| MaxDB           | 7210                    |
| Neo4j           | 7473                    |
| ArangoDB        | 8529                    |
| Cassandra       | 7000,7001,9042          |
| InfluxDB        | 8086                    |
| Elasticsearch   | 9200,9300               |
| CouchDB         | 5984                    |
| MongoDB         | 27017,27018,27019,28017 |
| Redis           | 6379                    |
| Riak            | 8087,8088               |
| RethinkDB       | 828015,29015,28015      |
| Solr            | 7574,8983               |
| Golang debugger | 2345                    |
| Node debugger   | 5858,9229               |
| Java debugger   | 5005                    |
| Ruby debugger   | 1234                    |
| Python debugger | 4444,5678               |

In you need make these ports public, you can use [endpoints](/docs/reference/compose/#endpoints-object-optional).

#### scale (int, optional)

Specify the number of containers running for each service (default: `1`).

```yaml
scale: 2
```

#### resources (object, optional)

Configure resource [requests and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      cpu: 300m
      memory: 500Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 800Mi
```

`reservations` translates to Kubernetes `requests`.

#### restart (string, optional)

Defines the policy that the platform will apply on container termination.

- `always/unless-stopped/any`: The default restart policy. The policy always restarts the container until its removal.
- `none/never/no`: The policy does not restart a container under any circumstances.
- `on-failure`: The policy restarts a container if the exit code indicates an error.

```yaml
deploy:
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    max_attempts: 3
```

If the restart policy is other than always, the service will be translated to a Kubernetes Job.

#### stop_grace_period (duration|int, optional)

Specify how long to wait when attempting to stop a container before sending SIGKILL.
If no unit of time is given, the system will interpret the number in seconds.

```yaml
stop_grace_period: 10s
```

#### volumes ([string], optional)

Define volumes accessible by the containers of a service at a given path.

```yaml
volumes:
  - redis:/data
```

The volume `redis` must be defined in the [volumes section](/docs/reference/compose/#volumes-object-optional).

The following notation is also accepted:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /data
```

Host volumes are used by `okteto up` to infer the [sync paths](/docs/reference/manifest/#sync-string-required) between your local filesystem and your remote development container.

#### working_dir (string, optional)

Override the default working directory of the container image `WORKDIR`.

```yaml
working_dir: "/app/code"
```

### volumes ([object], optional)

List of volumes created by the Docker Compose file.
Volumes are mounted on the containers of a given service by referring the volume from the [volumes field](/docs/reference/compose/#volumes-string-optional) of the service.

```yaml
volumes:
  redis:
    driver_opts:
      size: 1Gi
```

Each volume has the following properties:

#### labels (string, optional)

Specify labels for the volume. They translates to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: redis
```

#### driver_opts.class (string, optional)

Specify the storage class of the volume.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  class: standard
```

#### driver_opts.size (string, optional)

Specify the size of the volume. Defaults to 1Gi.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  size: 1Gi
```

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of Docker Compose files that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Environment variable substitution

It’s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: "app:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in your Docker Compose file in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the Docker Compose file.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat docker-compose.yml
services:
   web:
      image: "app:${TAG}"
```

When you run `okteto deploy` the `web` container uses the image `app:v1.5`.

> Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.

### extensions (object, optional)

Specifies a configuration that can be used in other services using anchors.
Every top-level field starting with the prefix 'x-' will be interpreted as an extension.

```yaml
x-function: &environment
  environment:
    DEV_MODE: yes
    DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
services:
  app:
    <<: *environment
    image: okteto.dev/example
```

### Okteto Secrets

You can also use your [Okteto Secrets](/docs/cloud/secrets/) in your Docker Compose file.

For example, if your have an Okteto Secret named `PASSWORD` whose value is `change-me!`, the following Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}
```

will use `change-me!` for the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable of the `mysql` service when you run `okteto deploy`.

> Values in the shell and/or the `.env` file take precedence over those specified in Okteto Secrets.

## Okteto Cloud makes Docker Compose even more powerful!

Okteto extends the Compose Specification to make it even easier for you and your team to build cloud-native applications.

### endpoints ([object], optional)

Endpoints expose HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
Use this instead of having to run a NGINX proxy in your Docker Compose file.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - path: /
    service: frontend
    port: 80
  - path: /api
    service: api
    port: 8080
```

The endpoint uses the name of the development environment to generate a URL with the following format: https://NAME-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net.

Each endpoint has the following properties:

#### path (string, required)

The request path that will handle this route.

#### service (string, required)

The service that will receive the request.

#### port (int, required)

The port that will receive the request.

If more than one endpoint is needed, you can declare multiple endpoints by using a map with the name of the endpoint and its specification:

```yaml
endpoints:
  landing:
    - path: /
      service: nginx
      port: 80
  web:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 80
    - path: /api
      service: api
      port: 8080
```

In this case, the URLs `landing-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net` and `web-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net` are created.

`endpoints` also accepts an extended notation to specify labels for each endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  rules:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 3000
    - path: /api
      service: backend
      port: 8080
```
