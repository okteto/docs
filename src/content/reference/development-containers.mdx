One of the advantages of using Okteto is the ability to configure development environments as code, side by side with your application.

Instead of having to keep a wiki with a never-ending list of tools, dependencies, and scripts to install and run, you just have to clone your repository, deploy your application, and run `okteto up` to start developing in seconds.

## Getting started

At a high level, a development environment is a Docker container that contains:

- One or more language runtimes (e.g python, ruby, node)
- SDKs for your language runtime (e.g JDK, python-dev)
- Binary dependencies (e.g. openssl, git)
- Tools to manage and install dependencies (e.g. pip, bundler, yarn)
- Tools to run your tests and analyze your code (e.g nosetest, pylint)
- Your source code

When you run the `okteto init` command on a local repository, `okteto` will analyze your source code and will guess the main programming language you're using.
Based on this, it will select a base development container configuration and create a default `okteto.yml` for you.

For example, if your repository is mostly `golang`, it will look like this:

```yaml
name: dev
image: golang:alpine
volumes:
  - /go/pkg/
  - /root/.cache/go-build/
forward:
  - 8080:8080
```

Out of the box, Okteto maintains pre-configured development images in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/okteto/devenv) for the following languages:

- dotnetcore
- golang
- java
- node
- php
- python
- ruby
- rust

## Create your own

The default development images are a great way to start.
They use the latest official docker image for your language runtime and include the most common developer tools and a custom bash prompt.
But they might not have everything you need. Your team might need to support a very specific version of your runtime, or you might need some extra tooling available.

Do the following to create your own development image:

1. Create a Dockerfile
1. Pick a base image
1. Add your extra dependencies, tools, and files
1. Build your image, tag it, and push it to your docker registry
1. Update the `image` key in your `okteto.yml` with your new image

Besides following [Docker's best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/), we also recommend the following:

- Create the docker image in CI, so it's clear how and when it was built
- Pin all your dependencies, so there aren't any surprises
- Keep the Dockerfile in your repository, next to your code
- When using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), use your development image as the builder stage, so that you have the same tools and images in dev than in CI/CD
