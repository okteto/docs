title: Okteto Manifest Reference
description: Okteto's manifest for describing development containers
sidebar_label: Manifest Reference
id: manifest
---

`okteto.yml` is a manifest format for describing development containers.
It declares the deployment target, the dev container, the folders to be synchronized, and other information required to activate your development container.

## Example

```yaml
name: vote
selector:
  app.kubernetes.io/part-of: vote
  app.kubernetes.io/component: api
image: python:3
command: ["python", "app.py"]
workdir: /usr/src/app
sync:
 - .:/usr/src/app
environment:
  - name=$USER
  - environment=development
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
forward:
  - 8080:80
  - 5432:postgres:5432
reverse:
  - 9000:9001
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 2000
  fsGroup: 3000
  capabilities:
    add:
    - SYS_PTRACE
```

## Schema reference

### affinity (Affinity, optional)

Affinity allows you to constrain which nodes your development container is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: role
          operator: In
          values:
          - web-server
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

More information about affinity is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

### autocreate (bool, optional)

If set to true, `okteto up` creates a deployment if `name` doesn't match any existing deployment in the current namespace (default: `false`).

### command (string, optional)

Sets the command of your development container. If empty, it defaults to `sh`:

```yaml
command: bundle exec thin -p 3000
```

The command can also be a list:

```yaml
command: ["bundle", "exec", "thin", "-p", "3000"]
```

### container (string, optional)

The name of the container in your deployment you want to put on development mode. By default, it takes the first one.

### context (string, optional)

The kubeconfig context of the deployment you want to put on development mode. By default, it uses the current kubeconfig context.

> You can also use the `OKTETO_CONTEXT` environment variable to set the kubeconfig context for all your okteto commands. The context defined in the okteto manifest will take priority over the `OKTETO_CONTEXT` environment variable.

For example, to force that `okteto up` always run on your *minikube* context, you can define:

```yaml
context: minikube
```

You can use an environment variable to replace the context field, or any part of it:

```yaml
context: $DEV_CONTEXT
```

### divert (object, optional)

Adding divert to your manifest modifies how development mode is enabled.
Development mode, without a divert configured, always replaces the target deployment with a development container.
Development mode, with a divert configured, will duplicate the target deployment, ingress, service, and port used by the deployment.
HTTP traffic will then be diverted to the duplicated deployment when the new ingress is used.

The divert option has the benefit of allowing you to use both the original application and the actively developed application side-by-side, depending on which ingress is used.

```yaml
divert:
  ingress: api
  service: api
  port: 8080
```

- `ingress`: the name of the Kubernetes ingress to be duplicated for the development deployment
- `service`: the name of the Kubernetes service to be duplicated for the development deployment
- `port`: optionally defines the service port used when there are multiple ports

Code changes must also be made to your application in order to make use of a divert.
The divert functionality relies on the use of HTTP headers.
In particular the `x-okteto-dvrt` header, added by the duplicate ingress, must be propagated by each application.
This is similar to the stratagy use for tracing and a library for Go can be found [here](https://github.com/okteto/divert).

### docker (object, optional)

Allows you to automatically inject a Docker in Docker (DinD) sidecar in your development environment. This feature is only supported in [Okteto Enterprise](https://okteto.com/enterprise).

```yaml
docker:
  enabled: true
  image: docker:20-dind
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
```

- `enabled`: set to `true` to inject the DinD sidecar in your development environment (default: `false`)
- `context`: the image of the DinD sidecar container (default: `docker:20-dind`)
- `resources`: resources configuration of the Did sidecar container

When DinD is enabled, the okteto [persistent volume](https://okteto.com/docs/reference/manifest/#persistentvolume-object-optional) must be enabled too.
The DinD container uses the okteto persistent volume to persist `/var/lib/docker`, the folder used by Docker to store image cache layers.

Your Okteto Registry credentials are injected automatically into your development environment allowing you to pull and push docker images from the [Okteto registry](https://okteto.com/docs/cloud/registry/).

### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables to your development container. If a variable already exists on your deployment, it will be overridden with the value specified on the manifest.

Environment variables with only a key, or with a value with a `$` sign resolve to their values on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

```yaml
environment:
  environment: development
  name: user-${USER:peter}  ## will be replaced by the value of $USER or by "peter" if the the variable USER doe not exist
  DBPASSWORD: ## will be given the value of $DBPASSWORD if it exists
```

#### envFiles

Add environment variables to your development container from a file.

```yaml
envFiles:
  - .env1
  - .env2
```
Environment variables declared in the environment section override these values.

### externalVolumes ([string], optional)

A list of persistent volume claims (not managed by okteto) that you want to mount in your development container.
This is useful to share cache information between different development containers.
For example, to share the go cache between different development containers, you could define:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - go-cache:/root/.cache/go-build/
```

on different okteto manifests. You can also mount a relative subpath of a given peristent volume claim:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - pvc-name:subpath:/var/lib/mysql
```

### forward ([string], optional)

A list of ports to forward from your development container.
The list should follow the `localPort:remotePort` notation and each element should be unique.

You can also access other services running in your namespace by using the notation `localPort:remoteService:remotePort`.

```yaml
forward:
  - 8080:80
  - 5432:postgres:5432
```

You can also use the extended notation below to configure the service to be exposed using a label selector or its name.

```yaml
forward:
  - localPort: 8080
    remotePort: 80
    name: app
  - localPort: 5432
    remotePort: 5432
    labels:
      app: db
```

Once your development container is up and running, you will be able to access the port directly by using `localhost:localPort`.

> Common uses of port forwarding are:
>
>1. Access a service via `localhost` instead of via an ingress
>1. Remote debugging
>1. Connect to a hot reloader via a websocket

If Okteto can't forward a port (typically because they are already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.


### initContainer (object, optional)

Allows you to override the okteto init container configuration of your development container.

```yaml
initContainer:
  image: okteto/bin:1.2.22
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
```

### healthchecks (bool, optional)

This field is **deprecated** in favor of [probes](/docs/reference/manifest/#probes-boolean-optional) and will be removed in future versions.

If set to true, health checks (liveness, readiness, and start probes) are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

More information about health checks is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

### interface (string, optional)

Port forwards and reverse tunnels will be bound to this address. Defaults to `localhost`.

```yaml
interface: 0.0.0.0
```

### image (string, optional)

Sets the docker image of your development container. Defaults to the image specified in your deployment.

> More information on development images [here](/docs/reference/development-environment/)

You can use an environment variable to replace the image, or any part of it:

```yaml
image: okteto/dev:$USER
```

> More information on how to use private images for your development container [is available here](/docs/reference/faqs/#how-to-use-private-images).

Use the extended notation to configure how to build your dev image when running `okteto up --build`:

```yaml
image:
  name: okteto/golang:1
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
  target: dev
  args:
    - ENV1=dev
    - ENV2=$VALUE
```

- `name`: the container image of your development container. The same as the `image` single notation.
- `context`: the build context sent to BuildKit. When the value supplied is a relative path, it's relative to the location of the okteto manifest file (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It's a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the multi-stage build [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

### imagePullPolicy (string, optional)

The image pull policy of your development environment (default: `Always`)

### lifecycle (boolean, optional)

If set to true, postStart and postStop lifecycle events are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
More information about lifecycle events is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which events to enable/disable:

```yaml
lifecycle:
  postStart: false
  postStop: true
```

- `postStart`: specifies if the postStart event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `postStop`: specifies if postStop event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

### metadata (object, optional)

The metadata field allows to inject labels and annotations into your development container.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    fluxcd.io/ignore: "true"
  labels:
    custom.label/dev: "true"
```

### name (string, required)

The name of your development environment. If [selector](/docs/reference/manifest/#selector-mapstringstring-optional) is not defined, this will be used to determine what resource to put on development mode. 

### namespace (string, optional)

The namespace of the deployment you want to put on development mode. By default, it takes the current kube config namespace.

You can use an environment variable to replace the namespace field, or any part of it:

```yaml
namespace: $DEV_NAMESPACE
```

### nodeSelector (map[string]string, optional)

List of labels that the node must have to include the development container on it.

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
```

More information about nodeSelector is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).


### persistentVolume (object, optional)

Allows you to configure the okteto persistent volume:

- `enabled`: enable/disable the use of persistent volumes (default: `true`)
- `storageClass`:  the storage class of the volume (default: the `default` storage class)
- `size`:  the size of the okteto persistent volume (default: `2Gi`)

```yaml
persistentVolume:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: standard
  size: 30Gi
```

Note the following limitations:

- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [services](/docs/reference/manifest/#services-object-optional).
- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [volumes](/docs/reference/manifest/#volumes-string-optional).

### probes (boolean, optional)

If set to true, liveness, readiness, and start probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

More information about probes is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which probes to enable/disable:

```yaml
probes:
  liveness: true
  readiness: true
  startup: true
```

- `liveness`: specifies if liveness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `readiness`: specifies if readiness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `startup`: specifies if startup probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

### push (object, optional)

Allows you to configure how to build your image when running `okteto push`:

- `context`: the build context sent to BuildKit. When the value supplied is a relative path, it's relative to the location of the okteto manifest file (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It's a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the multi-stage build [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.


```yaml
push:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
  target: prod
  args:
    - ENV1=prod
    - ENV2=$VALUE
```

### resources (object, optional)

Allows you to override the resources configuration of your development container.
It follows the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container). By default, `requests` and `limits` are unset.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "64Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1Gi"
```

### remote (integer, optional)

The local port to use for SSH communication with your development environment. Defaults to a random value.

```yaml
remote: 2222
```

> Setting this value in the manifest is equivalent to starting your development container with the `okteto up --remote=2222` command.

### reverse ([string], optional)

A list of ports to reverse forward from your development container to your local machine.
The list should follow the `remotePort:localPort` notation and each element should be unique.

```yaml
reverse:
  - 9000:9001
  - 8080:8080
```

Once your development container is up and running, any requests to `0.0.0.0:remotePort` in the development container will be directed to `localhost:localPort`

> Common uses of reverse forwarding are:
>
>1. Remote debugging
>1. Send events or logs to your local machine

If Okteto can't reverse forward a port (typically because they're already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.

### secrets ([string], optional)

A list of secrets that will be injected into your development container.
The format of a secret is `LOCAL_PATH:REMOTE_PATH:MODE`. `LOCAL_PATH` must exist, `REMOTE_PATH` must be an absolute path, and `MODE` is the remote file permissions in Base-8 (optional: defaults to `644`).

```yaml
secrets:
  - $HOME/.token:/root/.token:400
```

### securityContext (object, optional)

Allows you to override the pod security context of your development container.

Okteto supports overriding the `fsGroup`, `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup` and `capabilities` values.
They're not set by default, and they follow the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 2000
  fsGroup: 3000
  capabilities:
    add:
    - SYS_PTRACE
```

> Non-root Containers:
>
>  If you're using a non-root container, and the runAsUser and runAsGroup values are not specified in your Kubernetes manifest, you need to set these values in your Okteto manifest. Remember to use the numeric ID in all cases, not the human readable name.

### selector (map[string]string, optional)

The labels of the Kubernetes deployment/statefulset you want to put on development mode.
They must identify a single Kubernetes deployment/statefulset.

```yaml
selector:
   app.kubernetes.io/name: vote
```

### services ([object], optional)

A list of other containers (other than the main development container) that you want to put on developer mode.
The difference with the main development container and the ones defined in this section is that the main development container gives you an interactive session, where you can, for example, execute a shell.
The containers defined in this section run in detached mode, but they can also mount your local folders in a particular path.

For example, to put a Django application on developer mode you could use the following manifest:

```yaml
name: web
command: ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8080"]
sync:
  - .:/app
services:
  - name: worker
    command: ["celery", "worker", "-A", "myproject.celeryconf", "-Q", "default", "-n", "default@%h"]
    sync:
      - .:/app
```

and both deployments, `web` and `worker` will mount your local folder `.` into the path `/app`.

The supported keys for containers defined in this section are:

1. `annotations`
1. `command`
1. `container`
1. `environment`
1. `image`
1. `labels`
1. `name`
1. `namespace`
1. `resources`
1. `sync`
1. `tolerations`
1. `workdir`

They work the same as for the main container, except for the `command` and `name` keys.
For `services`, `command` defaults to the command specified in your deployment, instead of `sh`.
`labels` and `name` are mutually exclusive (for the main container, `name` is mandatory).

### sync ([string], required)

Specifies local folders that must be synchronized to the development container.

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
```

`sync` supports relative paths and environment variable expansion:

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
  - config:/etc/config
  - $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh
```

> Use the `.stignore` file on each local folder to avoid synchronizing build artifacts, dependencies, or git metadata. [More information is available here](/docs/reference/file-synchronization/)

File sync can only update files that can be modified by your development container User ID.
If you are using okteto with persistent volumes, rememeber to set the field [securityContext.runAsUser](#securitycontext-object-optional) if your development container User ID is not `root`.

> You can [use secrets](/docs/reference/manifest/#secrets-string-optional) if you need to synchronize a single file instead of a folder

There is also an extendend `sync` notation to fine tune the file synchronization service:

```yaml
sync:
  folders:
    - .:/code
  verbose: false
  compression: true
  rescanInterval: 100
```

- `folders`: list of local folders that must be synchronized to the development container
- `verbose`: enable verbose logging for syncthing (default: `true`)
- `compression`: compress files before synchronizing them (default: `false`)
- `rescanInterval`: the synchronization service [rescan internal](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/syncing.html?highlight=rescan#scanning) in seconds. It can be set to zero to disable rescans (default: `300`)

### timeout (time, optional)

Maximum time to be waiting for creating a development container until an error is returned.

```yaml
timeout: 5m
```

You can also use the extended notation below to specify max time to be waiting for resources.

```yaml
timeout:
  default: 3m
  resources: 5m
```

### tolerations ([object], optional)

A list of tolerations that will be injected into your development container.

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu
    operator: Exists
```

### volumes ([string], optional)

A list of paths in your development container that you want to associate to persistent volumes.
This is useful to persist information between `okteto up` executions, like downloaded libraries or cache information.
For example, to speed your go builds up, you could define:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /go/pkg/
  - /root/.cache/go-build/
```

You can also mount a relative subpath of your local folder:

```yaml
volumes:
  - data:/var/lib/mysql
```

### workdir (string, optional)

Sets the working directory of your development container.

If the `sync` field is not specified, `workdir` automatically adds a `sync` section to your okteto manifest. For example:

```yaml
workdir: /okteto
```

is equivalent to:

```yaml
workdir: /okteto
sync:
  - .:/okteto
```

This behavior is **deprecated** and will be removed in future versions. Define your synchronized folders using the [sync](/docs/reference/manifest/#sync-string-required) field of your okteto manifest.

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of the Okteto Manifest that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Substitute environment variables

It’s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside an Okteto Manifest file:

```yaml
image: "node:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in the Okteto Manifest file in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the Okteto Manifest.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat okteto.yml
name: app
image: "node:${TAG}"
```

When you run `okteto up` the `app` container uses the image `node:v1.5`.

> Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.

## Advanced Scenarios

### Prevent okteto from interacting with sensitive namespaces

If you add the `dev.okteto.com/not-allowed=true` label to a namespace, `okteto up` will automatically fail. You can use this to prevent you or your team from deploying a development environment into a sensitive namespace, like staging or production.

```
$ kubectl label namespace staging dev.okteto.com/not-allowed=true
```

```
$ kubectl get namespace staging -oyaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/not-allowed: "true"
  name: staging
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes
```

### User-level overrides

User-level overrides can be used to modify or augment the okteto manifest included in your project's repository. You can use this to synchronize extra files, set a different context, change the command, add new environment variables, etc...
In order to override the values of an existing manifest, you'll need to create a file named `.okteto/okteto.yaml` in your home directory.   Any values specified in this fill will overwrite or merge with the values specified in your repository's okteto manifest file.
