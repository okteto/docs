[Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) gives you free access to secure Kubernetes namespaces, fully integrated with remote development capabilities.
Develop your applications in Okteto Cloud and forget about slow and tedious local development forever.

With Okteto Cloud you can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](docs/getting-started/) or from your [Git Repositories](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-git/).
- Configure [Secrets](/docs/cloud/secrets/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](/docs/cloud/ssl/) for your services, [Private Endpoints](/docs/cloud/private-endpoints/) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](/docs/cloud/custom-domains/).
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/cloud/build).
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](/docs/cloud/registry).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces/) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](/docs/cloud/credentials/) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Visualize your workloads in a Developer-focused Kubernetes dashboard.
