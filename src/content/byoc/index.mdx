description: Introduction to Okteto Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)
---

Okteto’s Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) offering allows you to run Okteto on your own cloud infrastructure while still enjoying the benefits of a fully managed experience.

This is ideal for teams who need to meet strict security or compliance requirements, operate at high-scale, require custom infrastructure configurations, or simply want to maintain full control over their environments with a SaaS-like experience.

We currently support BYOC on:

- [**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**](byoc/aws/index.mdx)
- [**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**](byoc/gcp/index.mdx)

## How the BYOC Model Works

With BYOC, you bring the cloud provider account; we bring the platform and operational expertise.

- You provision and secure the cloud account
- Okteto creates the all the necessary cloud infrastructure and software components
- Our team manages and maintains Okteto on your cloud, including upgrades, monitoring, and incident response
- You retain full ownership of your cloud environment and data

## 🤝 What You Can Expect from Okteto

When you connect your cloud to Okteto:

- Okteto installs and manages its components in your cloud
- Our team handles upgrades, patching, and observability of Okteto services
- You retain full control of your cluster and data, Okteto only interacts with workloads required for our platform to function
- Continuous monitoring and observability of Okteto services
- Support and guidance is provided by our team throughout your journey

## ⚠️ Important: Cluster Management Restrictions {#important-cluster-management-restrictions}

**Do not manually modify cluster infrastructure directly in your cloud provider console or CLI**, even though you have the necessary permissions.

### What You Should Not Modify

- Kubernetes cluster configuration (node pools, machine types, disk sizes, etc.)
- Resources in Okteto-managed namespaces (including `okteto`, `default`, and system namespaces)
- Infrastructure managed by Okteto's configuration management
- Load balancers, networking, or storage resources created by Okteto

### Why This Is Critical

Manual modifications to cluster infrastructure create several serious problems:

1. **Infrastructure State Conflicts**: Okteto manages your cluster infrastructure with automated daily reconciliation. Manual changes create state inconsistencies that can cause:
   - Automatic reversion of your changes during the next reconciliation
   - Configuration management failures that prevent critical updates
   - Unintended resource deletions or recreations

2. **SLA and Support Impact**: When you modify infrastructure directly, Okteto cannot guarantee our SLA commitments. The remediation for issues may be entirely on your side, outside of our control.

3. **Missing Context**: Okteto's infrastructure is configured based on specific architectural decisions and requirements. Manual changes without this context can cause unexpected side effects or service degradation.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Direct modifications can trigger false alerts for our SRE team and mask real issues that need attention.

### What To Do Instead

If you need infrastructure changes or want to install additional tools:
- **Contact Okteto first** - reach out to your Okteto representative or support team
- We'll coordinate the change through proper channels to ensure it's compatible with our managed infrastructure
- For approved changes, we'll implement them through our infrastructure management tooling to maintain consistency

**If you manage infrastructure yourself, the BYOC model is not the right fit.** BYOC means Okteto manages the cluster while you retain ownership of the cloud account and data.
