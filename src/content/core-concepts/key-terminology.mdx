Okteto consists of two components: the Okteto CLI and the Okteto Platform. Each is responsible for a critical part of the product experience and there are several important terms and concepts that help to understand how it all works together.

| Terminology   | Description | References |
| :------: | ------ | ------ | 
| **Namespace** | A secure and isolated Kubernetes environment where development and preview environments are deployed. Each user of Okteto receives their own namespace and can create additional namespaces. | [Reference](manage-app/namespaces.mdx) |
| **Development environment** | A collection of containerized microservices and/or other resources that comprise a single software application. Shown in the Okteto UI as a collapsible item in the `Namespaces` view and labeled as a `Dev Environment`.  | Reference |
| **Preview environment** | These environments enable you to include a live preview of your changes on every pull request. It facilitates better collaboration with your team's technical and non-technical members. | [Reference](manage-app/preview-environments/preview-environments-overview.mdx) |
| **Catalog** | A list of pre-configured applications configured by an administrator. Launching a development environment for these applications requires little-to-no effort from developers. | [Reference](deploy/deploy-from-catalog.mdx) |
| **Okteto manifest** | A configuration file (e.g. `okteto.yaml`) containing instructions for the Okteto CLI and Platform to launch a development environment and its components. | [Reference](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx) |
| **Secrets** | Okteto's manifest supports the use of secrets that can be defined either at the user (namespace) or admin (instance) level. | [Reference](deploy/manifest/secrets.mdx) |
