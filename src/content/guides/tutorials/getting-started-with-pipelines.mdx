This tutorial provides a step by step guide to configure an [Okteto Pipeline](deploy/okteto-pipeline.mdx).
Okteto Pipelines allow anyone on your team or your open source community to deploy a realistic environment for your application on Okteto in just one click.

## Overview

The tutorial is composed of the following steps:

- Step 1: Code the Hello World application
- Step 2: Define a Dockerfile for building the Docker image of the Hello World application
- Step 3: Create Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Hello World application on Okteto
- Step 4: Automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Pipeline
- Step 5: Deployment time!

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Code the Hello World application

We will use a simple Hello World application to illustrate how to configure an Okteto Pipeline.
The Hello World application is a simple web service that responds "Hello World!" to every request.
It is written in Go, but Okteto can be used with any application that runs on Kubernetes.

First, make a new directory called `hello-world` and move inside it:

```console
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
```

Create a new file under the name `main.go` with the following content:

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Starting hello-world server...")
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloServer)
    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}

func helloServer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello world!")
}
```

`main.go` implements a Golang web server that listens on port 8080 and responds to every Http request with the message _Hello world!_

Next, initialize your go module running the following command:

```console
$ go mod init go-getting-started
```

## Step 2: Define a Dockerfile for building the Docker image of the Hello World application

You need to build a Docker image and push it to a Docker registry before Okteto can run your application.

To do that, you need to define a `Dockerfile`.
A `Dockerfile` file is a sequence of instructions to build the Docker image of your application.
If you're not familiar with Docker, we strongly recommend you [learn about it](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker).

Open a new file under the name `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:buster

WORKDIR /app
ADD . .
RUN go build -o app

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

## Step 3: Create Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Hello World application on Okteto

To deploy an application to Okteto, you need to define it using Kubernetes manifests.

Let's start by creating a new folder for the Kubernetes manifests:

```console
$ mkdir k8s
```

When you use a Kubernetes manifest, you tell Kubernetes how you want your application to run. This time, you'll create a deployment object. Create a new file `k8s/deployment.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello-world
          image: okteto.dev/hello-world:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

The deployment manifest has three main sections:

- `metadata` defines the name for your deployment.
- `replicas` defines how many copies of it you want running.
- `template` tells Kubernetes what to deploy, and what labels to add. In this case, a single container, with the `okteto.dev/hello-world:latest` image we will build in our Okteto Pipeline, listening on port 8080, and with the `app: hello-world` label. Note that this label is the same used in the `selector` section.

> If you want to know more about Kubernetes deployment objects, check the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

You'll now need a way to access your application. You can expose an application on Kubernetes by creating a service object. Create a new file called `k8s/service.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-world
```

The service manifest has four main sections:

- `metadata` tells Kubernetes how to name your service
- `type` tells Kubernetes how you want to expose your service. In this case, it will expose it externally through a Load Balancer. In you want to **expose your application using ingress**, check the [docs](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx#bring-your-own-ingress).
- `ports` tells Kubernetes which ports you want to expose
- `selector` tells Kubernetes how to direct traffic. In this case, any pod with the `app: hello-world` label will receive traffic.

> Kubernetes manifests can get complex to manage. As your application grows, we recommend you pack your application using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

You now have everything ready to define the Okteto Pipeline of the Hello World application.

## Step 4: Automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Pipeline

You can automate the deployment of the Hello World application with an Okteto Pipeline to provide a one-click deployment experience for anyone in your team or your open source community.
To define your Okteto Pipeline, create a new file `okteto-pipeline.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
deploy:
  - okteto build -t okteto.dev/hello-world:latest
  - kubectl apply -f k8s
```

The Okteto Pipeline manifest has a `deploy` section to define the sequence of commands to deploy the Hello World application.

- The first command builds the Docker image of the Hello World application and pushes the image to the [Okteto Registry](core/components/container-registry.mdx).
  Note that `okteto.dev/hello-world:latest` is expanded to the current user image space to make this instruction portable between namespaces.

- The second command deploys the Hello World application using `kubectl` and the Kubernetes manifests you created on Step 2.

You can make use of tools such as `kubectl`, `helm`, `okteto`, and `kustomize` in your Okteto Pipeline.
Read the Okteto Pipeline [documentation](deploy/okteto-pipeline.mdx) to learn more about the Okteto Pipeline yaml syntax, available tools, and environment variables that you can use as part of your Okteto Pipeline.

## Step 5: Deployment time!

Log into your Okteto instance (eg. https://okteto.example.com).
Click on the **Deploy** button on the top left of the Okteto dashboard, select "**Git URL**" as the source
and type the URL of your Git repository to deploy the Hello World application:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/deploy-from-git.png").default}
    alt="deploy a git repository"
    width="650"
  />
</p>

After a few seconds, your application will be ready. You can access the Hello World application by clicking its endpoint:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/okteto-hello-world-ui.png").default}
  alt="Okteto dashboard of Hello World app"
  width="850"
/>

> You can make the deployment experience even smoother by adding a [Develop on Okteto](deploy/develop-on-okteto-button.mdx) button to the `README.md` file of your Git repository.
