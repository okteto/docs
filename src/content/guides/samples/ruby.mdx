This tutorial will show you how to develop and debug a Ruby application using Development Containers.

## Prerequisites

Install and configure the Okteto CLI to access your Okteto instance. Follow the [Okteto CLI installation guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) if you haven't done it yet.

## Step 1: Deploy the Ruby Sample App

Get a local version of the Ruby Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/ruby-getting-started
$ cd ruby-getting-started
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yml` file. This file describes how to deploy the application.

```yaml
deploy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

> Using [remote: true](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy-remotely) instructs Okteto to run the commands in the cluster.

Deploy the application by executing:

```console
$ okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Running kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
deployment.apps/hello-world created
service/hello-world created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/hello-world created
 âœ“  Development environment 'ruby-getting-started' successfully deployed
```

Log into the Okteto UI and click on the application endpoint:

/>

Did you notice that you're accessing your application through an HTTPs endpoint? This is because Okteto will [automatically create them](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx) for you when you deploy your application. Cool no ðŸ˜Ž?

## Step 2: Activate your Development Container

The [dev](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a Development Container for the Ruby Sample App:

```yaml
dev:
  hello-world:
    command: bash
    sync:
      - .:/opt/app/
    forward:
      - 1234:1234
    volumes:
      - /usr/local/bundle/cache
```

The `hello-world` key matches the name of the hello world Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:

- `command`: the start command of the Development Container
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the Development Container
- `forward`: a list of ports to forward from your Development Container to localhost in your machine. This is needed to configure the Ruby debugger
- `volumes`: a list of paths in your Development Container to be mounted as persistent volumes. For example, this is useful to persist the bundle cache

Also, note that there is a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your Development Container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts or git metadata.

Next, execute the following command to activate your Development Container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 âœ“  Persistent volume successfully attached
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world
    Forward:   1234 -> 1234

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your Development Container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application in hot-reload mode by running the following command:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> ruby app.rb
```

```console
[2022-07-04 16:50:53] INFO  WEBrick 1.6.1
[2022-07-04 16:50:53] INFO  ruby 2.7.6 (2022-04-12) [x86_64-linux]
== Sinatra (v2.0.8.1) has taken the stage on 8080 for production with backup from WEBrick
[2022-07-04 16:50:53] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=79 port=8080
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page to test that your application is running.

## Step 3: Remote Development with Okteto

Open the `app.rb` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 7 to be _Hello world from the cluster!_. Save your changes.

```ruby
get "/" do
  message = "Hello world from the cluster!"
  message
end
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your Development Container in Kubernetes and Sinatra automatically detects them and reloads your application.

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required ðŸ˜Ž!

## Step 4: Remote debugging with Okteto

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE. Let's take a look at how that works in VS Code, one of the most popular IDEs for Ruby development. If you haven't done it yet, install the [Ruby extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) available from Visual Studio marketplace. This extension comes with debug definitions covering the default `ruby-debug-ide` client setup.

Now, cancel the execution of `ruby app.rb` from the Development Container shell by pressing `ctrl + c`. Rerun your application in debug mode:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> rdebug-ide --host 0.0.0.0 app.rb
```

```console
Fast Debugger (ruby-debug-ide 0.7.0, debase 0.2.4.1, file filtering is supported) listens on 0.0.0.0:1234
```

Open the _Run_ view in VS Code and run the _Connect to okteto_ debug configuration (or press the F5 shortcut):

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Connect to okteto",
      "type": "Ruby",
      "request": "attach",
      "remotePort": "1234",
      "remoteHost": "localhost",
      "remoteWorkspaceRoot": "/opt/app",
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
    }
  ]
}
```

> You should be replacing the value of `remoteWorkspaceRoot` with wherever your application code is.

Add a breakpoint on `app.rb`, line 8. Go back to the browser and reload the page. The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc...

Your code is executing in Okteto, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools. Pretty cool no? ðŸ˜‰

## Next steps

Congratulations, you just developed **your first application in Okteto** ðŸš€.

Okteto lets you develop your applications directly on Kubernetes. This way you can:

- Eliminate integration issues by developing in a realistic environment
- Test your application end to end as fast as you type code
- No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Develop at the speed of the cloud!

Next, learn more about customizing your [development images](deploy/development-environments.mdx) for a better developer experience.
