Okteto is a platform that simplifies the process of launching cloud development environments without requiring the expertise to do this yourself. This enables developers to automatically spin up fully-managed development environments that emulate production as closely as possible. Okteto eliminates the friction of local development environments, the many deviations that can exist for the same engineering organization, and the troubleshooting that comes with them.

This tutorial will show you how to develop and debug a Python application using Okteto.

## Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the Okteto CLI and configure it to access Okteto. [Follow our getting started guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) if you haven't done it yet.

## Step 1: Deploy the Python Sample App

Get a local version of the Python Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/python-getting-started
$ cd python-getting-started
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yaml` file. This describes how to [build](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#build-object-optional) and [deploy](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy-string-optional) the Python Sample App.

```
build:
  hello-world:
    image: okteto.dev/python-hello-world:1.0.0
    context: .
deploy:
  - kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

Deploy your development environment by executing:

```console
$ okteto deploy --build
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Building image for service 'hello-world'
 i  Building the image 'okteto.dev/python-hello-world:1.0.0' in tcp://buildkit.okteto.example.com:1234...
[+] Building 5.9s (11/11) FINISHED
 ...
 âœ“  Image 'registry.okteto.example.com/cindy/python-hello-world:1.0.0' successfully pushed
 i  Running kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
deployment.apps/hello-world created
service/hello-world created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/hello-world created
 âœ“  Development environment 'python-getting-started' successfully deployed
 i  Run 'okteto up' to activate your development container
```

Log into your Okteto instance and click on the URL of the application:

/>

Did you notice that you're accessing your application through an HTTPs endpoint? This is because Okteto will [automatically create them](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx) for you when you deploy your application. Cool no ðŸ˜Ž?

## Step 2: Activate your development container

The [dev](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a development container for the Python Sample App:

```
dev:
  hello-world:
    command: bash
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    sync:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    reverse:
      - 9000:9000
    volumes:
      - /root/.cache/pip
```

The `hello-world` key matches the name of the hello world Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:

- `command`: the start command of the development container.
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the development container.
- `reverse`: a list of ports to reverse forward from your development container to your local machine
- `volumes`: a list of paths in your development container to be mounted as persistent volumes. This is useful to persist the pip cache.

Also, note that there is a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your development container.
This is useful to avoid virtual environments, build artifacts, or git metadata.

Next, execute the following command to activate your development container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 âœ“  Persistent volume successfully attached
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world
    Reverse:   9000 <- 9000

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your development container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application in development mode by running the following command:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> python app.py
```

```
Starting hello-world server...
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page to test that your application is running.

## Step 3: Remote Development with Okteto

Open the `app.py` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 7 to be _Hello world from the cluster!_.
Save your changes.

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World from the cluster!'
}
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your development container.
Flask's auto-reloader will detect the changes automatically and restart the application with the new code.

```console
 * Detected change in '/usr/src/app/app.py', reloading
 * Restarting with stat
Starting hello-world server...
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 308-916-374
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required ðŸ˜Ž!

## Step 4: Remote debugging with Okteto

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE.
Let's take a look at how that works in one of python's most popular IDE's, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

> For VS Code users, this [document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_debugging-by-attaching-over-a-network-connection) explains how to configure the debugger with `debugpy`.

First, open the project in PyCharm and remove the comments on `app.py` line `20`.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  print('Starting hello-world server...')
  # comment out to use Pycharm's remote debugger
  attach()

  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Second, launch the [Remote Debug Server](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-debugging-with-product.html) by clicking on the Debug button on the top right.
Ensure that the Debug Tool Window shows the `Waiting for process connection...` message. This message will be shown until you launch your app on the development container shell and it connects to the Debug Server.

```console
Starting hello-world server...
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
Starting hello-world server...
Connecting to debugger...
```

On your local machine, switch to the Debug Tool Window. Once the app connects it will show the connection to the pydev debugger.
Press the `resume` button to let the execution continue.

<Image

  alt="debugging with Python"
  width="850"
/>

Add a breakpoint on `app.py`, line 10. Go back to the browser and reload the page.

The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc.

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/python-debug.png").default}
  alt="breakpoint in Python"
  width="850"
/>

Your code is executing in Okteto, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools.
Pretty cool no? ðŸ˜‰
