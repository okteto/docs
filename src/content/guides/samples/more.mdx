We have getting started guides explaining how to configure your Development Containers for the following languages:

- [ASP.NET](guides/samples/aspnetcore.mdx)
- [Go](guides/samples/golang.mdx)
- [Java](guides/samples/java.mdx)
- [Node.js](guides/samples/node.mdx)
- [PHP](guides/samples/php.mdx)
- [Python](guides/samples/python.mdx)
