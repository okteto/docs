description: Use Development Containers to hotreload and debug your app with Okteto
---

Okteto makes it easier to develop on Kubernetes by using Development Containers.
Development Containers allow you to hot reload and debug your app running on Okteto **as fast as you type code** ðŸš€

Development Containers work for applications of all shapes and forms. We have getting started guides for the following languages:

- [ASP.NET](guides/samples/aspnetcore.mdx)
- [Go](guides/samples/golang.mdx)
- [Java](guides/samples/java.mdx)
- [Node.js](guides/samples/node.mdx)
- [PHP](guides/samples/php.mdx)
- [Python](guides/samples/python.mdx)
- [Ruby](guides/samples/ruby.mdx)

Take a look at [our samples repository](https://github.com/okteto/samples) to see more examples of how to build, deploy and develop applications on Okteto with different programming languages, frameworks, and deployment tools.

Are we missing your favorite framework or programming language? [File an issue](https://github.com/okteto/samples/issues/new) and let us know!
