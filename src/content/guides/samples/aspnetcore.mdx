Okteto is a platform that simplifies the process of launching cloud development environments without requiring the expertise to do this yourself. This enables developers to automatically spin up fully-managed development environments that emulate production as closely as possible. Okteto eliminates the friction of local development environments, the many deviations that can exist for the same engineering organization, and the troubleshooting that comes with them.

This tutorial will show you how to develop and debug an ASP.NET application using Okteto.

## Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the Okteto CLI and configure it to access Okteto. [Follow our getting started guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) if you haven't done it yet.

## Step 1: Deploy the ASP.NET Sample App

Get a local version of the ASP.NET Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/aspnetcore-getting-started
$ cd aspnetcore-getting-started
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yaml` file. This describes how to [build](reference/manifest.mdx#build-object-optional) and [deploy](reference/manifest.mdx#deploy-string-optional) the ASP.NET Sample App.

```
build:
  hello-world:
    image: okteto.dev/aspnet-hello-world:1.0.0
    context: .
  hello-world-dev:
    context: .
    target: dev
deploy:
  - kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

Deploy your development environment by executing:

```console
$ okteto deploy --build
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ example.okteto.com as context
 i  Building image for service 'hello-world'
 i  Building the image 'okteto.dev/aspnet-hello-world:1.0.0' in tcp://buildkit.example.okteto.com:1234...
[+] Building 5.9s (11/11) FINISHED
 ...
 ‚úì  Image 'registry.example.okteto.com/cindy/aspnet-hello-world:1.0.0' successfully pushed
 i  Running kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
deployment.apps/hello-world created
service/hello-world created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/hello-world created
 ‚úì  Development environment 'aspnet-getting-started' successfully deployed
 i  Run 'okteto up' to activate your development container
```

Open your browser and go to the URL of the application. You can get the URL by logging into your Okteto instance (e.g https://example.okteto.com) and clicking on the application's endpoint:

<Image center src="/docs/guides/samples/images/okteto-ui.png" alt="Okteto UI ASP.NET" width="850" />

Did you notice that you're accessing your application through an HTTPs endpoint? This is because Okteto will [automatically create them](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx) for you when you deploy your application. Cool no üòé?

## Step 2: Activate your development container
The [dev](reference/manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a development container for the ASP.NET Sample App:
```
dev:
  hello-world:
    image: ${OKTETO_BUILD_HELLO_WORLD_DEV_IMAGE}
    command: bash
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
    remote: 2222
```

The `hello-world` key matches the name of the hello world Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:
- `image`: the image used by the development container. More information on development images [here](reference/development-environments.mdx) and [dynamic value for the tag](reference/manifest.mdx#build-object-optional)
- `command`: the start command of the development container.
- `environment`: the environment variables added or overwritten in your development container.
- `remote`: the local port to use for SSH communication with your development environment.

Also, note that there is a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your development container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, or git metadata.

Next, execute the following command to activate your development container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 ‚úì  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ‚úì  Images successfully pulled
 ‚úì  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your development container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application by running the following command:

```console
default:hello-world app> dotnet watch run
```

```console
dotnet watch ‚åö Polling file watcher is enabled
dotnet watch üî• Hot reload enabled. For a list of supported edits, see https://aka.ms/dotnet/hot-reload.
  üí° Press "Ctrl + R" to restart.
dotnet watch üîß Building...

      Hosting environment: Development

      Content root path: /okteto
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page to test that your application is running.

## Step 3: Remote Development with Okteto

Open the file `Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs` in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 25 to be *Hello world from Okteto!*. Save your changes.

```csharp
        [HttpGet]
        public string Get()
        {
             return "Hello world from Okteto!";
        }
```

Take a look at the development container shell and notice how the changes are detected by `dotnet watch run` and automatically built and reloaded.

```console
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application is shutting down...
watch : Exited
watch : File changed: /src/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
watch : Started
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
            Content root path: /src
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required üòé!

## Step 4: Remote debugging with Okteto

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE. Let's take a look at how that works in VS Code using the VS dotnet debugger.

For this step, we're going to use the `C#` extension for VS Code. If you don't have it, you can [install it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp#review-details). You might need to restart your VS Code instance.

Open `HelloWorldController.cs` in VS Code, set a breakpoint on line `26` and press `F5`. VS Code will connect to your development container via SSH and give you a list of processes you can attach to. Scroll through the list and select the `helloworld` process, as shown below (you can also type `helloworld` in the search bar directly).

<Image center borderless src="/docs/guides/samples/images/aspnetcore-attach.png" alt="ASP.NET processes to attach to" width="850" />

Once you select the process, VS Code will switch to debug view, launch the debugger, and attach it to the process you just selected. You'll know it's finished when the status bar at the bottom turns orange.

<Image center borderless src="/docs/guides/samples/images/aspnetcore-connected.png" alt="ASP.NET connection status bar" width="850" />

Go back to the browser and reload the page. As soon as the service receives the request, the execution will halt at your breakpoint and VS Code will jump to the front of the screen. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc.

<Image center borderless src="/docs/guides/samples/images/aspnetcore-debug.png" alt="ASP.NET core debug" width="850" />

Your code is executing in Okteto, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools. Pretty cool no? üòâ
