Okteto offers two different approaches to service development: `sync` or `hybrid` mode. This mode is configured in your Okteto manifest and affects the behavior of [`okteto up`](/reference/okteto-cli.mdx#up).

`Sync` is the default mode and code changes made to the local filesystem are synchronized to the remote development container deployed in the cluster. Alternatively, `hybrid` mode enables you to run the service in development locally while keeping the rest of the application components in the cluster.

### Deciding which mode to use

There are situations when running a service locally is faster than synchronizing code with a remote development container. For example: when doing frontend-only development or when working in an IDE-heavy context (e.g. Java/Spring) where the IDE may be pre-configured to run tests, start services, and connect debuggers.

When using Okteto's `hybrid` mode you can maintain your local development experience for the specific service you're working on while still leveraging the benefits of hosting the rest of your application's components in the remote development container.

> Using `hybrid` might increase latency when accessing the rest of the services in the cluster.

### How hybrid development works

To allow communication to and from the cluster and your local machine an SSH server is deployed in the remote development container. You can expose the local service to the services running in the cluster using the [`reverse`](/reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#reverse-string-optional) configuration for the development environment. If you want to forward a service running in the cluster to your local machine you can use the [`forward`](/reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#forward-string-optional) configuration.

When using `hybrid` mode the process running locally is designed to run with the same environment as the original service running in the cluster. To achieve this, the following environment variables are added to the local process running the service in `hybrid` mode. This list is ordered from highest to lowest prevalence:

- Environment variables defined in the [environment](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#environment-string-optional) of the development container
- Environment variables defined in the original [container spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/)
- Environment variables coming from [configmaps](https://kubernetes.io/es/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#configmaps-y-pods) defined in the original container spec
- Environment variables coming from [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/#define-container-environment-variables-using-secret-data) defined in the original container spec
- Environment variables defined in the [container image](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/#container-images)

### How to develop in hybrid mode

To enable `hybrid` mode you only need to configure the necessary ports to expose the local service to the cluster network. This allows the components running in the cluster to communicate with the local service as if it was running directly in the cluster.

To do this you can make use of the [reverse](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#reverse-string-optional) field in your Okteto manifest, which will expose the configured port of your local machine to the desired port on the development container.

```yaml
dev:
  frontend:
    mode: hybrid
    reverse:
      - 3000:8080
    workdir: ./frontend
    command: ["yarn start"]
```

In this example we have configured the `frontend` service to use `mode: hybrid`. This means Okteto will redirect requests to the frontend service in the cluster to your local machine.

Okteto will execute (locally) the command defined in the `command` field and in the directory specified in `workdir`. To simulate the same environment as the original container, certain environment variables are autoinjected into the process running locally. More about which environment variables are added to the local process [here](#how-hybrid-development-works). Additionally, anything exposed locally on port `8080` will be exposed on port `3000` of the development container. This makes it possible for other components running on the cluster to access the local service as if it were running remotely in the cluster.
