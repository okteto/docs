## Sleeping resources

To automatically save resources in your cluster, you can configure Okteto to automatically scale inactive applications and resources to zero if they haven't been used for longer than the `inactivity` period.

## Inactive Applications and Resources

Okteto considers an application or resources inactive if a user hasn't performed any of the following tasks during the `inactivity` period:

- Upgrade or redeploy via the UI or the command line.
- Launched a development container with `okteto up`.
- Pushed the latest version of your code with `okteto push`.

Service accounts, config maps, secrets, or volumes you create will be unaffected by this operation.

## Wake sleeping resources

Okteto's UI will notify you when there are sleeping resources in your namespace. Press the **Wake all** button to activate all sleeping resources at once.

Sleeping resources are also started if anyone visits any of the public endpoints of your application.

## Delete Unused Namespaces

Namespaces and all the resources and data contained within will be deleted if they are not used for longer than the `deletion` period.

## Persistent resources  <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

In case you are interested on the garbage collector but you want to skip some specific namespace, you can mark it as `persistent`. To do so, you can add the label `dev.okteto.com/persistent` to it or [use the admin view](manage-okteto/admin-dashboard.mdx#namespaces-section).

In case you want more granularity and only want to persist specific deployments or statefulsets within a namespace, you can include the label `dev.okteto.com/persistent` on those resources. In that case, the garbage collector will ignore only those specific resources while scaling down the rest of the namespace.


## Configuration Steps  <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

You can consult the `deletion` and `inactivity` periods in the [Admin Dashboard](manage-okteto/admin-dashboard.mdx).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="self-hosted"
  values={[
    { label: 'Self-Hosted', value: 'self-hosted', },
    { label: 'SaaS', value: 'saas', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="self-hosted">

You can enable and customize the `inactivity` and `deletion` periods via the [garbage collector's settings](get-started/configure/configuration-settings.mdx#gc).
