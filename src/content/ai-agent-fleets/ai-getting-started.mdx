Welcome to AI Agent Fleets! This guide will help you get up and running quickly with AI-powered development agents in your Okteto environments.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- ✅ Your administrator has enabled AI Agent Fleets for your organization
- ✅ You have access to the Okteto Dashboard
- ✅ You can see the **Agents** tab in your dashboard

Don't see the Agents tab? Contact your administrator to request access.

## 🚀 Your First Agent in 3 Minutes

### Step 1: Open the Agents Tab
Navigate to the **Agents** tab in your Okteto Dashboard.

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

You have two options:

#### Option A: Work with an Existing Repository
- Paste your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo`)
- The agent will clone and analyze your codebase
- Perfect for adding features or fixing bugs

#### Option B: Start Fresh
- Select "New Project"  
- Describe what you want to build
- The agent will create everything from scratch

### Step 3: Describe Your Task

Write a clear, specific prompt. For example:

```
Create a Python FastAPI application with:
- User registration endpoint with email validation
- Login endpoint returning JWT tokens
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy
- Automated tests for all endpoints
```

### Step 4: Launch and Monitor

1. Press **Enter** or click **Launch Agent**
2. Watch the real-time logs as your agent:
   - Sets up the environment
   - Installs dependencies
   - Writes code
   - Runs tests
   - Validates the implementation
3. Click on **Open Editor** to view an embedded Visual Studio Code where you can monitor and audit all code changes

### Step 5: Review and Deploy

Once complete:
- **Preview**: Click any generated endpoints to see your app live
- **Review**: Check the code changes and test results
- **Accept**: Just ask the agent to create a pull request

## 💡 Quick Tips for Success

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Do This ✅**
```
"Add a REST endpoint at /api/users/:id/avatar that accepts 
image uploads (JPEG/PNG only, max 5MB), resizes to 200x200, 
stores in S3, and returns the CDN URL"
```

**Not This ❌**
```
"Add image upload"
```

### Common First Tasks

Start with these proven scenarios:

1. **Add an API Endpoint**
   ```
   Add a health check endpoint at /health that returns 
   server status, database connectivity, and uptime
   ```

2. **Create a New Service**
   ```
   Create a Node.js microservice for sending emails with 
   SendGrid, including templates and retry logic
   ```

3. **Fix a Bug**
   ```
   Debug why the user authentication is failing with 
   401 errors after 15 minutes and implement a fix
   ```

4. **Add Tests**
   ```
   Write comprehensive unit tests for the OrderService 
   class with at least 80% coverage
   ```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Think Big
- Begin with simple, well-defined tasks
- Build confidence with successful completions
- Gradually increase complexity

### 2. Provide Context
Good prompts include:
- **What**: The specific feature or fix needed
- **Where**: Relevant files, endpoints, or services
- **How**: Technical requirements or constraints
- **Why**: Business logic or user needs (when relevant)

### 3. Leverage Parallel Agents
Run multiple agents simultaneously:
- Agent 1: Adding new features to the frontend
- Agent 2: Optimizing database queries
- Agent 3: Writing documentation

### 4. Review Before Merging
Always:
- Run the preview environment
- Check test results
- Review code for security and best practices
- Validate against your requirements

### 5. Iterate and Refine
If the first result isn't perfect:
- Provide specific feedback
- Ask for modifications
- Guide the agent with additional context

## 🔧 Common Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Describe the feature** with acceptance criteria
2. **Let agent implement** the initial version
3. **Test in preview** environment
4. **Request adjustments** if needed
5. **Create PR** when satisfied

### Bug Fixing Workflow

1. **Describe symptoms** and error messages
2. **Let agent investigate** and propose fix
3. **Verify fix** in preview environment
4. **Run regression tests**
5. **Deploy fix** via PR

### Refactoring Workflow

1. **Specify refactoring goals** (performance, readability, etc.)
2. **Define constraints** (maintain API compatibility, etc.)
3. **Review changes** carefully
4. **Validate** all tests still pass
5. **Deploy incrementally**

## 🚨 When to Use AI Agent Fleets

### Perfect For ✅
- CRUD operations
- API endpoints
- Data transformations
- Test writing
- Bug fixes with clear symptoms
- Documentation updates
- Boilerplate code
- Database migrations

### Think Twice About 🤔
- Core authentication/authorization logic
- Payment processing
- Complex architectural decisions
- Cryptographic implementations
- Performance-critical algorithms

### Not Recommended For ❌
- Production secrets/credentials
- Regulatory compliance code (without review)
- Mission-critical security features (without expert review)


## 🔍 Understanding Agent Capabilities

AI Agents can:
- ✅ Read and understand your entire codebase
- ✅ Install packages and dependencies
- ✅ Create new files and modify existing ones
- ✅ Run commands and scripts
- ✅ Execute and debug tests
- ✅ Access [Okteto environment variables](core/okteto-variables.mdx) and configs
- ✅ Interact with databases
- ✅ Call external APIs
- ✅ Generate comprehensive documentation

AI Agents cannot:
- ❌ Access production environments
- ❌ Bypass your CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Merge code without approval
- ❌ Access secrets not provided to the environment
- ❌ Modify Okteto platform settings



## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Agent is taking too long
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Provide more specific instructions
- Check to see if your environment is running low on resources

### Agent doesn't understand my codebase
- Ensure repository is accessible
- Provide context about architecture
- Reference specific files/patterns

### Tests are failing
- Specify test requirements clearly
- Provide example test cases
- Check environment dependencies

### Can't see preview environment
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Check service health endpoints
- Verify port configurations
