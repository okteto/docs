This guide covers the complete setup and configuration process for enabling AI Agent Fleets in your Okteto organization.

## Prerequisites
Before configuring AI Agent Fleets, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your Okteto organization
- An API key from either Anthropic or AWS (for Amazon Bedrock)
- A Git token for repository integration (if not, we'll help you set one up)

## Step 1: Access the Configuration Panel

Log in to your Okteto Dashboard with administrator credentials
Navigate to the Admin section in the left sidebar
Select AI Agent Fleets from the settings menu

## Step 2: Enable AI Agent Fleets
Toggle the AI Agent Fleets switch to enable the feature for your organization.

Once enabled, you'll see additional configuration options appear.

## Step 3: Configure Access Control
Choose who can use AI Agent Fleets in your organization:
### Option A: Enable for All Users

Select All users to grant access to everyone in your organization
This is recommended for smaller teams or during initial rollout

### Option B: Enable for Selected Users

Select Selected users
Click the users view link to navigate to user management
Select specific users who should have access to AI Agent Fleets
Save your selections


Note: Users without access will not see the Agents tab in their dashboard.

## Step 4: Configure Your LLM Provider
AI Agent Fleets requires an LLM provider to power the Claude Code agents. Choose between Anthropic (direct) or Amazon Bedrock.
### Option A: Anthropic Configuration
Use this option for direct integration with Anthropic's API.

// Add image

Select Provider: Choose Anthropic from the Provider dropdown
Obtain API Key:

Click the "Get your Anthropic API key →" link
Sign in to your Anthropic account (or create one)
Navigate to API Keys section
Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
Copy the key


Enter API Key: Paste your Anthropic API key in the field
Save Configuration: Click Update to save your settings

### Option B: Amazon Bedrock Configuration
Use this option if your organization prefers AWS-managed AI services.

// Add image

Select Provider: Choose Amazon Bedrock from the Provider dropdown
Configure Region:

Select the AWS region where you have Bedrock enabled
Common regions: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1
Ensure Claude models are available in your selected region


Set Up AWS Credentials:

Click "Get your Bedrock API key →" for setup instructions
You'll need either:

AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
IAM role with appropriate Bedrock permissions


Required AWS Permissions:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:model/anthropic.claude-*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Enter Credentials: Add your AWS credentials in the API Key field
Save Configuration: Click Update to save

## Step 5: Configure LLM Model
The LLM Model section shows which Claude model is being used:

Currently, agents use Claude Sonnet 4, optimized for software development tasks
This model provides the best balance of speed and capability for code generation
Additional models will be available in future releases


Note: The model selection is currently managed by Okteto to ensure optimal performance. Custom model selection will be added in a future update.

## Step 6: Set Up Git Integration
Configure Git integration to enable agents to create pull requests and manage code:

// add image

Generate Token:

Click "Generate a new GitHub token →"
You'll be redirected to GitHub (or your Git provider)
Create a token with these permissions:

repo (full repository access)
write:pull_request (create PRs)
read:user (read user profile)




Configure Token:

Copy the generated token
Paste it in the Git Token field
Click Update to save


Supported Git Providers:

GitHub
GitLab
Bitbucket (coming soon)



## Step 7: Verify Configuration
After completing setup:

Test Provider Connection:

The system will automatically verify your API key
Look for a green checkmark indicating successful connection


Check User Access:

Log in as a non-admin user (if using selected users)
Verify the Agents tab appears for authorized users


Launch Test Agent:

Create a simple test agent to verify full functionality
Example: "Create a hello world Python script"



Configuration Best Practices
API Key Management

Rotate keys regularly: Change API keys every 90 days
Use separate keys: Don't share keys between environments
Monitor usage: Track token consumption and costs
Set alerts: Configure notifications for unusual usage patterns

Access Control

Start small: Begin with selected users during initial rollout
Train users: Provide guidelines before granting access
Review regularly: Audit user access monthly
Document policies: Create clear usage guidelines

Cost Management
For Anthropic Direct:

Monitor token usage in your Anthropic dashboard
Set spending limits if available
Consider prepaid credits for predictable costs

For Amazon Bedrock:

Use AWS Cost Explorer to track Bedrock usage
Set up AWS Budgets for cost alerts
Consider Reserved Capacity for consistent workloads

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Provider Connection Failed

Verify API key is correct and active
Check network connectivity to provider
Ensure firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS

Users Can't See Agents Tab

Confirm user is in selected users list
Have user log out and back in
Clear browser cache

Git Integration Not Working

Verify token has correct permissions
Check token hasn't expired
Ensure repository access is configured

Security Considerations
API Key Security

Store API keys securely using Okteto's encrypted storage
Never share API keys in code or documentation
Use environment-specific keys (dev, staging, prod)
Enable API key access logs where available


Compliance

Review your organization's AI usage policies
Ensure compliance with data residency requirements
Document AI usage for audit purposes
Consider GDPR/CCPA implications for generated code



## Next Steps
After configuration:

Create Usage Guidelines: Document best practices for your team
Run Training Sessions: Help users understand effective prompting
