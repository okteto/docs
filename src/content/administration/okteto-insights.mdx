Okteto inherently captures a lot of data about user's usage. This consists of product usage and behavior (i.e. developers) data and infrastructure utilization and performance (i.e. admins) data. But this data is not easily available today for Okteto admin users. The idea behind Okteto Insights is to provide a way for Okteto administrators to get and consume this data.

By default, this feature is disabled. To enable it you just need to set the helm setting [`insights.enabled`](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#insights) to `true` and upgrade your Okteto instance.

## How to consume Okteto Insights' data

Once you enable the feature, Okteto will create a new endpoint accesible through `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN/metrics` where data will be available in Prometheus format. This new endpoint is protected with a bearer token which is auto-generated by Okteto, or you can specify your own through the secret defined under this [helm setting](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#insights).

Then, you can configure a scrapper to connect to this endpoint using the proper token. An example of a Prometheus scrapper configuration is:

```yaml
      - job_name: 'okteto_scrapper'
        scrape_interval: 5m

        scheme: http
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['okteto.<SUBDOMAIN>:443'] # replace <SUBDOMAIN> with your Okteto subdomain
        authorization:
          type: Bearer
          credentials: <bearer-token> # replace <bearer-token> with the token generated by Okteto
```

> Be aware that Okteto does not provide a Prometheus instance or storage for this data, so you need to deploy your own Prometheus instance (or other collector platform) to consume this data and take care of counters and metrics restart with the functions Prometheus provides.

## What data is available

Okteto will progressively add more data exposed through this endpoint, but the following metrics are available today:

- `okteto_system_node`: This metric is a [gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge) which represents the number of nodes running Okteto. This metric doesn't have any label.
- `okteto_system_node_memory_bytes`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total allocatable memory in bytes for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.
- `okteto_system_node_memory_requested_bytes`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total [requested](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) memory in bytes for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.
- `okteto_system_node_memory_usage_bytes`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total memory in use in bytes for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.
- `okteto_system_node_cpu_cores`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total allocatable CPU cores for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.
- `okteto_system_node_cpu_requested_cores`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total [requested](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) CPU cores for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.
- `okteto_system_node_cpu_usage_cores`: This metric is a gauge which represents the total CPU cores in use for a node. It has the following labels:
    - `node_name`: It contains the node name.

> All metrics provided by Okteto will have the prefix `okteto_`, so they are easily identifiable and filtered.
