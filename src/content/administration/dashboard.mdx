# Admin Dashboard  <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

The Admin Dashboard provides a web UI to see various details of your Okteto instance in a centralized location and offers features for managing parts of the Okteto experience for your users.

You can access the Admin Dashboard by clicking on the `Admin` icon on the left sidebar.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/admin_dashboard_sidebar.png" alt="Admin dashboard tabs" width="300" /></p>

This Admin view consists of the following views currently:

- [General](#general)
- [Users](#users)
- [Nodes](#nodes)
- [Namespaces](#namespaces)
- [Previews](#previews)
- [Secrets](#secrets)
- [Catalog](#catalog)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Registry Credentials](#registry-credentials)

We will cover these in more detail below.

## Accessing the dashboard

Only accounts with the administrator role will be able to access the Administration Dashboard. The first user signing up into your Okteto instance will automatically become the initial administrator.

You can promote other accounts to the administrator role in the `Users` section of the Admin Dashboard or by adding the `dev.okteto.com/super: "true"` label to the corresponding `serviceAccount` in Kubernetes.

## General

The overview section of the Admin Dashboard is designed to give you a high level view of your entire Okteto instance. From here, you can drill down into more specific settings and details. This section currently shows you the following information:

- Your current pricing plan
- Okteto Helm chart version
- Okteto CLI version
- Expiration date of your license
- Number of available seats
- Number of nodes in your cluster
- Number of namespaces in your Okteto instance
- Number of preview environments currently active
- Git SSH key
- Autoscaler configuration
- Garbage Collector configuration

With the exception of the `Settings` section, this data is informative only. The `Settings` section contains a few configurable settings to help you customize your Okteto instance as necessary.

## Users

From this section you can manage all users in your Okteto instance. This is a list of all users that have created an account in your Okteto instance, their respective roles, and with appropriate actions to manage their membership.

:::info

The `User` column is also the user's default `namespace` name/id. For example, a `User` value of "darryl" means that that user's namespace will also be called "darryl". Any additional namespaces created by "darryl" will show up only in the `Namespaces` tab.

:::

On this page an administrator will be able to:

- View the total number of users on the Okteto instance (The `Total` value in the top right of the table)
- View each user's name, email, and avatar
- View when a user was `Last Seen` (any user who recently sent any API request to Okteto, e.g. from the browser, CLI, GitHub actions)
- Change each user's role (Select `User` or `Admin` from the dropdown menu in the `Role` column)
- Remove users (Click the `(X) Remote` button on the far right)

:::caution

Removing the user will automatically remove all the namespaces owned by the deleted user.

:::

## Nodes

In this section of the Admin Dashboard, you can find the following system information about your Kubernetes cluster, separated by node:

- Number of running pods
- Number of volumes in use
- Memory utilization
- CPU utilization

You can use this information to configure [the autoscaler](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#autoscaler) and optimize your Okteto installation.

## Namespaces

This view enables you to manage all of the namespaces within your Okteto instance, including the ability to view (masquerade as the user), wake, or persist any namespace. The top of the namespace table also shows you the default settings for the [garbage collection](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#gc) configuration.

For each namespace, an administrator can:

- View the name, owner, status (`Active` or `Sleeping`), and when it was last active
- Get `read-only` access to any namespace managed by Okteto (using the `View` option)
- Manually wake the namespace (using the `Wake Namespace` option)
- Mark the namespace as `persistent` (using the `Keep Awake` option) to exempt it from the [garbage collection](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#gc) process

## Previews

Similar to the [namespaces section](#namespaces), the `Previews` section shows you a list of all [Preview Environments](/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments/) that exist in your Okteto instance.

From this page, an administrator can view the default settings for the [garbage collection](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#gc) configuration and view any of the listed preview environments.

This table provides a consolidated view about preview environments, including:

- Preview environment name
- Owner
- Scope (`Personal` or `Global`)
- Status (`Active` or `Sleeping`)
- Last seen

## Secrets

The Secrets section of the Admin dashboard lets you define cluster-wide secrets. Using the `$SECRET_NAME` syntax, you can refer to these secrets directly in your Okteto manifest. They are also injected into the [environment running](/cloud/okteto-cli.mdx#built-in-tools-when-deploying-to-okteto-cloud) the commands in the `deploy` section of the manifest.

:::info

Secrets [defined by the user](/cloud/secrets.mdx) take precedence over the secrets defined here in case of a name collision.

:::

We recommend using [build secrets](/reference/manifest.mdx#build-object-optional) to inject sensitive data into your Dockerfile.

The example below shows how to configure your okteto manifest to mount a local `.env` file into your Dockerfile:

```yaml
build:
  api:
    context: .
    secrets:
      my_env: .env
```

You can refer to this secret from your Dockerfile using the syntax below:

```
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=my_env,target=/etc/secrets/.env cat /etc/secrets/.env
```

The content of the `.env` file would be:

```
${MY_PASSWORD}
```

where `MY_PASSWORD` can be a local environment variable or an Okteto Secret, and it gets subsituted by Okteto before mounting the file as a build secret.

## Catalog

This section of the Admin dashboard enables you to create a [catalog](/administration/catalog/) of pre-defined development environments for anyone in your Okteto instance to deploy quickly from their `Launch Dev Environment` screen. You can reduce the amount of time it takes a developer to get up and running by defining these catalog entries so they're available for developers to select and launch with minimal to no configuration.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/catalog_table_view_sidebar.png" alt="Catalog table view" width="900" /></p>

:::info

This feature is currently available for SaaS single-tenant and Self-Hosted customers only. It is not available in Okteto Cloud, our free cloud service.

:::

In this view you can see the name, repository URL, and edit any pre-existing catalog entries. Please see our [Catalog documentation](/administration/catalog/#add-an-application-to-the-catalog) to learn more about how to modify each field.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/catalog_entry_form_sidebar.png" alt="Catalog entry form" width="900" /></p>

This makes it simple and fast to edit your catalog entries as your environment changes to manage your applications from this central location.

## Installation

Okteto is a flexible platform that streamlines your developer operations to make developers faster and more efficient. The initial installation has a few steps and we've built a guided experience to help get you setup even faster than before.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/installation_view_sidebar.png" alt="Okteto installation view" width="700" /></p>

From this page you can follow a simple step-by-step guide to get the major components setup and have your Okteto installation ready to go in minutes. Each of these tasks comes with documentation to help guide you and are also skippable in case they don't apply to you or you simply wish to complete them later.

## Registry Credentials

This section of the Admin dashboard allows you to manage credentials for private registries that you want to use in your Okteto instance. Those credentials are injected by Okteto in any operation (build, deploy, etc...) done via CLI or the UI, so developers don't need access to them. You only need to configure your credentials here, and all the developers will be able to interact with those registries while developing with Okteto. If the setting [`daemonset.configurePrivateRegistriesInNodes.enabled`](/self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx/#daemonset) is enabled, Okteto's daemonset will also configure these credentials in the nodes, so the cluster can pull images from those registries.

For each configured registry, you will see a row with the type (Static or AWS) and the registry hostname. The 2 types of credentials supported are:
- Static: To configure registries with static username and password like Docker Hub.
- AWS: To configure [ECR registries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecr/index.html) using Access Key and Access Secret. In this case, Okteto takes care of refreshing docker credentials every 4 hours using the key and secret configured. The hostname of the registry has to end with `.amazonaws.com`.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/registry_credentials_view.png" alt="Registry credentials view" width="900" /></p>

Apart of adding new credentials, this view also allows you to rotate those credentials or delete them if you don't need them anymore. For sensitive data you only see the last few characters as a hint to verify the value.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/administration/images/registry_credentials_detail.png" alt="Registry credentials detail" width="700" /></p>

> Be aware that any change you do in those credentials might take a few minutes to be propagated to all the components in the cluster.

### Advanced configuration

This section of the Admin dashboard simplifies the configuration of these credentials in Okteto, but you can managed them in an advanced way creating Kubernetes resources directly. This is useful, for example, if you have your own mechanism to provision secrets in the cluster.

In order to do that, you need to create an [Opaque Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret) in the cluster with the data needed for the registry. Depending on the type of registry, you will need different fields. Once the secret is created, you will need to create a CRD for the registry refering to the secret which contains the data.

In that way, if you want to define static credentials (username and password) for a private registry, you just need to create a secret in the Okteto namespace with the user and pass to be used. After that, you have to define a CRD with some information. The name of the resource has to be the hostname of the registry, so imagine you want to add a configuration for docker's registry, you will need to create a resource like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: okteto
  name: index.docker.io # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  static:
    passwordSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the password
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the password is stored
    userSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the username
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the username is stored
```

In the case of AWS, where you have to specify the Access Key and Access Secret, the process is similar to the static credentials one. You will need to create a secret with those values, and then, create a CRD like this (the name of the resource has to be the hostname of the registry to be configured and it has to end with `.amazonaws.com`):

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: okteto
  name: 111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  awsIamUser:
    accessKeyIDSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access key is stored
    secretAccessKeySecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access secret key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access secret is stored
```

Last thing worth to mention is related to the label `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: okteto` in the CRDs. Adding that label means that the credentials will be editable from the UI, so any admin could come to this view and edit them. If the lifecycle of those credentials is managed directly by you outside Okteto, you can remove that label. Okteto will keep considering those credentials to be used, and they will keep showing in this view but as read only.
