# Authenticating with an SSH Key

> This feature is not available on [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com)

Okteto generates an SSH key the first time it boots. This key is the identity used by Okteto when cloning repositories while executing a [git deployment pipeline](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-git/). You can use this SSH key to give Okteto permission to clone private repositories.

## Get your Public Key 

The public SSH is available on the `Settings` section on the `Admin -> General` page. Click on the `Show SSH Key` button to reveal the value. This will only be displayed for users with the `Admin` role.

## Add the Public Key to your Source Code Provider
Once you have the public key, follow your source code provider's instructions on how to add the SSH key to your account. We recommend that you create a dedicated `bot` account for Okteto.

## Deploy a Private Repository

To deploy a private repository, use the `SSH` url of your git repository. This applies both when using the [`Deploy`](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-git) dialog in the dashboard and the [`okteto pipeline deploy`](/docs/reference/cli#deploy) command from your terminal.
