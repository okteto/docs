If you have configured Okta as your identity provider for Okteto, you can automatically deprovision users once they are deleted in Okta.
If you haven't yet configured Okta as your identity provider but would like to, please follow our [Installation Guide here](self-hosted/install/auth/okta.mdx).

Okteto provides an endpoint to receive Okta [event hooks](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/automation-hooks/event-hooks-main.htm) that will automatically deprovision users when they are deleted or deactivated from Okta.

:::note
Only the `user.lifecycle.deactivate` and `user.lifecycle.delete.initiated` events are supported. If more events are added they will be ignored.
:::

## Configuration

To set up the Okta event hook for user deprovisioning, follow these steps:

### 1.	Navigate to the Event Hooks Configuration

Within your Okta management console, navigate to `Workflows -> Event Hooks` and create a new event hook with the following configuration:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the event hook
- **URL**: `https://okteto.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.com/api/okta`
- **Authentication Field**: It must be set to `Authorization` as this is the field that Okteto uses to authenticate the request
- **Authentication Secret**: Provide a secret value that will be used to authenticate the request. This value should match the value provided in the Okteto Helm config (more info below)
- **Events**: Select the `User Deactivated` and/or `User Deleted` events

:::tip
Okteto handles both the User Deactivated and User Deleted events the same way, automatically deprovisioning the user in either case. If both events are selected, the User Deleted event will be skipped for users who are already deactivated.

### 2. Configure the Okteto Helm Chart

Okta requires verifying ownership of the URL before sending events. This is a special one-time event that Okta sends to the webhook and that Okteto understands.

To be able to receive this event and all subsequent `deactivate` and `delete` events, you need to enable the webhook in the Okteto Helm file and provide the same secret used in the event hook configuration:

```yaml
okta:
  events:
    enabled: true
    authSecret: my-secret
```

Once your event hook is created, and your Okteto instance is configured to receive the events, you can activate the webhook through the Okta admin console:


<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/okta-user-deprovision-verify.png").default}
    alt="Okta User Deprovision webhook verification"
     width="800"
  />
</p>


Once the webhook is verified, you will start receiving the `User Deactivated` and `User Deleted` events in your Okteto instance. Okteto will automatically deprovision these users from the system.

Events sent to the webhook appear in the `Reports -> System Log` tab which can be useful for troubleshooting.

:::note
This feature is compatible with Okteto Chart 1.29 and higher.
If you get a 404 error during the verification process, ensure your Okteto instance is at least version 1.29 and that `okta.events.enabled` is set to `true` in the Helm configuration.
