If you have configured Okta as your identity provider for Okteto, you can automatically deprovision users once they are deleted in Okta.
If you haven't yet configured Okta as your identity provider but would like to, please follow our [Installation Guide here](self-hosted/install/auth/okta.mdx).

Okteto provides an endpoint to receive Okta [event hooks](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/automation-hooks/event-hooks-main.htm) that will automatically deprovision users when they are deleted or deactivated from Okta.

:::note
Only the `user.lifecycle.deactivate` and `user.lifecycle.delete.initiated` events are supported. If more events are added they will be ignored.
:::

## Configuration

To set up the Okta event hook for user deprovisioning, follow these steps:

### 1.	Configure the Event Hook in Okta

Within your Okta management console, navigate to `Workflows -> Event Hooks` and create a new event hook with the following configuration:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the event hook
- **URL**: `https://okteto.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.com/api/okta`
- **Authentication Field**: It must be set to `Authorization` as this is the field that Okteto uses to authenticate the request
- **Authentication Secret**: Provide a secret value that will be used to authenticate the request. This value should match the value provided in the Okteto Helm config (more info below)
- **Events**: Select the `User Deactivated` and/or `User Deleted` events

:::tip
Okteto handles both the **User Deactivated** and **User Deleted** events the same way, automatically deprovisioning the user in either case. If both events are selected, the User Deleted event will be skipped for users who are already deactivated.

### 2. Configure Okta Deprovisioning in the Okteto Admin Dashboard

Okta requires verifying ownership of the URL before sending events.
This is a special one-time event that Okta sends to the webhook, and Okteto automatically handles this verification.

To be able to receive this event and all subsequent `deactivate` and `delete` events, you need to configure the webhook in the Okteto Admin Dashboard.

To configure deprovisioning in Okteto:
1. Navigate to **Admin → Integrations → Okta Deprovisioning** in the Okteto Admin Dashboard
1. Enter the Okta Event Hook Token used in your Okta event hook configuration
1. Click Enable to activate deprovisioning

Once your event hook is created and Okteto is configured to receive events, you can verify the webhook in the **Okta admin console**.

    src={require("@site/static/img/okta-user-deprovision-verify.png").default}
    alt="Okta User Deprovision webhook verification"
     width="800"
  />
</p>

### 3. Verify the Configuration

Once the event hook is created and the Okteto instance is configured, go back to the **Okta admin console** and verify the webhook.
After verification, Okteto will start receiving `User Deactivated` and `User Deleted` events, automatically deprovisioning users from the system.

Events sent to the webhook appear in the `Reports -> System Log` tab of Okta which can be useful for troubleshooting.

:::note
This feature is compatible with Okteto Chart 1.30 and higher.
If you get a 404 error during the verification process, ensure your Okteto instance is at least version 1.30.
