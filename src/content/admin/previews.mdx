# Managing Preview Environments <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

The Previews section of the Admin Dashboard provides administrators with a centralized view to manage all [Preview Environments](../previews/index.mdx) in your Okteto instance.


## Preview Scope

Preview environments can have one of two scopes:

- **Global Scope** (default): The preview environment is accessible to all members of your organization. These previews are visible to the entire team and can be managed by users with appropriate permissions.
- **Personal Scope**: The preview environment is only accessible to the owner and any shared member. These previews are indicated with a user icon next to the preview name in the preview list and are private to that account.

Preview environments use global scope by default. The scope determines who can view and interact with the preview environment within your organization.

## Filtering and Searching Previews

The preview environments list provides several filtering options to help you find specific previews:

- **Search** - Search for previews by name using the search box
- **Repository** - Filter by one or more repositories (searchable dropdown)
- **Status** - Filter by preview status such as active, sleeping, or error states
- **Owner** - Filter by the user who created the preview (searchable dropdown)
- **Updated** - Filter by when the preview was last updated:
  - Last hour
  - Last 24 hours
  - Last 7 days
  - Last 30 days
  - Last 90 days

You can combine multiple filters to narrow down your search results.

## Preview Table Columns

The preview environments table displays the following information for each preview:

- **Name** - The preview environment name with a user icon indicator for personal scope previews. Click the name to view details.
- **Repository** - The repository hosting the code, with a link to view it in your source control provider
- **Branch** - The Git branch being deployed in this preview
- **PR** - A link to the associated pull request
- **Owner** - The user who created the preview environment
- **Status** - The current status of the preview (e.g., active, sleeping, deploying)
- **Last Updated** - When the preview was last modified
- **Actions** - Available actions for managing the preview

## Managing Preview Environments

Each preview has an actions menu with the following options:

- **Delete** - Remove the preview environment. This option is only available if you have the necessary permissions.
- **Wake Preview** - Wake up a sleeping preview environment to make it active again
- **Sleep Preview** - Put an active preview to sleep to save resources. This option is disabled for previews marked as "Keep Awake"
- **Keep Awake** - Toggle to mark a preview as persistent, preventing it from automatically sleeping due to inactivity

:::tip
Marking a preview as persistent with "Keep Awake" will prevent it from being automatically put to sleep by the garbage collector, ensuring it remains available at all times.
