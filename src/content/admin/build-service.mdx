# Build Service Management

The Build Service admin view provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for your BuildKit infrastructure. This interface allows administrators to track real-time performance metrics, configure resource thresholds, and ensure optimal build performance across your Okteto instance.

## Overview

The Build Service uses BuildKit, a high-performance image builder, to power fast image builds and [remote executions](core/remote-execution.mdx).
The admin dashboard provides visibility into BuildKit pod health, resource utilization, and active build workloads.

For more information about optimizing BuildKit performance, see the [BuildKit High Performance guide](self-hosted/manage/buildkit-high-performance.mdx).

## Accessing the Build Service Dashboard

Navigate to **Admin → Build Service** in the Okteto UI to access the Build Service management interface.

## Metrics and Thresholds

The Build Service dashboard displays key metrics for each BuildKit pod and allows you to configure thresholds that determine when a pod is considered "Ready" to accept new build requests.

### Configurable Thresholds

You can configure the following thresholds from the admin UI:

#### CPU Pressure Threshold
- **Default**: 80%
- **Description**: Maximum CPU pressure allowed before a BuildKit pod is marked as busy. CPU pressure is measured in 10-second intervals and indicates how much the pod is CPU-constrained.
- **When to adjust**: Increase if builds are being queued unnecessarily when CPU usage is acceptable. Decrease if you notice build performance degradation at current levels.

#### Memory Pressure Threshold
- **Default**: 70%
- **Description**: Maximum memory usage allowed before a BuildKit pod is marked as busy. Memory usage is reported as a percentage out of 100%.
- **When to adjust**: Increase if you have sufficient memory headroom and want to maximize pod utilization. Decrease if memory pressure is causing OOM issues.

#### IOPS Pressure Threshold
- **Default**: 70%
- **Description**: Maximum I/O pressure allowed before a BuildKit pod is marked as busy. I/O pressure is measured in 10-second intervals and indicates disk I/O contention.
- **When to adjust**: Increase if using high-performance SSDs with greater I/O capacity. Decrease if experiencing I/O-related build slowdowns.

#### Active Builds Limit
- **Default**: 10
- **Description**: Maximum number of concurrent builds allowed per BuildKit pod before it is marked as busy.
- **When to adjust**: Increase if your BuildKit pods have sufficient resources to handle more concurrent builds. Decrease if concurrent builds are causing resource contention.

### Understanding Pod Status

Each BuildKit pod displays one of the following statuses:

- **Ready**: The pod is healthy and below all configured thresholds. It can accept new build requests.
- **Busy**: One or more metrics exceed the configured thresholds. The pod will not accept new build requests until metrics fall below thresholds.
- **Starting**: The pod is initializing and not yet ready to accept builds.
- **Stopping**: The pod is gracefully terminating, allowing active builds to complete.
- **Error**: The pod has encountered an error. Click "Error Reason" to view details.

### Disabling the Queue

The build queue can be disabled by setting the `OKTETO_BUILD_QUEUE_ENABLED` [feature flag](reference/feature-flags.mdx) to `false`. When disabled, builds are sent immediately to an arbitrary BuildKit pod, regardless of resource utilization or configured thresholds.

## Best Practices

### Threshold Configuration

- **Start with defaults**: The default thresholds (80% CPU, 70% memory, 70% IOPS, 10 active builds) work well for most workloads
- **Monitor and adjust**: Watch the metrics over time and adjust thresholds based on actual performance patterns
- **Balance utilization and performance**: Higher thresholds maximize resource utilization but may impact build performance
- **Consider build patterns**: If you have many small builds, you can increase the active builds limit. For resource-intensive builds, keep it lower
