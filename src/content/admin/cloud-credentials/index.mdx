In the Admin Dashboard, you can configure Cloud Credentials for your Okteto instance, providing a unified method for accessing your cloud account. These credentials are automatically used by Okteto in your deploy, destroy, and test commands, eliminating the need for developers to manage individual cloud credentials. Once configured, all developers can securely access your cloud provider using the Okteto cluster's identity, enhancing overall security and simplifying credential management.
