In the Admin Dashboard, you can set up cloud credentials for your Okteto instance. These credentials are automatically used by Okteto in your deploying steps, so developers don't need direct credential access. Once set, all developers can access the desired cloud provider resource through Okteto without additional steps.

Cloud credentials are injected to your deploy steps to allow access to your cloud provider resources.
