In the Admin Dashboard, you can configure Cloud Credentials for accessing your cloud account.
Cloud Credentials are automatically used by Okteto in your Okteto Manifest commands, eliminating the need to manage static credentials.
Once configured, all developers can securely access your cloud provider using the Okteto cluster's identity, enhancing overall security and simplifying credential management.
