In the Admin Dashboard, you can configure Cloud Credentials for accessing your cloud account.
Cloud Credentials are automatically used by Okteto in your Okteto Manifest commands, eliminating the need to manage static credentials.
Once configured, all developers can securely access your cloud provider using the Okteto cluster's identity, enhancing overall security and simplifying credential management.

Follow our guides below to learn how to configure your Cloud Credentials for supported cloud providers:

- [Amazon Web Services](admin/cloud-credentials/aws.mdx)
- [Google Cloud](admin/cloud-credentials/gcp.mdx)

## Manage Cloud Credentials using CRDs

You can also manage your [Cloud Credentials using CRDs](self-hosted/manage/crds.mdx#cloud-credentials).
This is useful, for example, if you have your own mechanism to provision cloud credentials in your cluster.

If you add credentials using CRDs they will be displayed in the UI, but they can't be modified from the UI. If you want to manage them from the UI, they must be created from there.
