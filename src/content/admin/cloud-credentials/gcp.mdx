This guide walks you through configuring Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials for your Okteto instance to enable the commands in your Okteto Manifests to interact with your GCP account.

We will focus on requesting access to Cloud Storage. However, you can extend this approach to grant access to other GCP resources by specifying a role with the necessary permissions.

GCP credentials are configured using [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).
This provides secure and temporary access to your GCP resources.

## Step 1: Create the Workload Identity Pool

:::info
We recommend installing the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) before following this tutorial
:::

A Workload Identity Pool is a group of identities that can be used to access GCP resources.

First, choose a name for your Workload Identity Pool and export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export POOL_ID=okteto-pool
```

Next, create the Workload Identity Pool by running the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create ${POOL_ID} --location=global --display-name="Okteto pool"
```

## Step 2: Register the OIDC Identity Provider

Within the newly created Workload Identity Pool, register your Kubernetes cluster as an OIDC Identity Provider in GCP.
To do this, Okteto provides the OIDC endpoint of your cluster, which can be found in the General section of your Okteto Admin Dashboard.

    alt="OIDC configuration in admin general view"
  />
</p>

Store these values as environment variables, you will use them in the next steps:

```bash
export OIDC_ENDPOINT=https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster
export OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=system:serviceaccount:okteto:okteto
```

The `AUDIENCE` is traditionally the client ID of the requester, and tokens will only be exchanged for these audiences.
It corresponds to the `aud` field in the JWT payload. We recommend creating a unique audience for each Okteto instance and GCP region:
For example:

```bash
export AUDIENCE=okteto.example.com/us-central1
```

Run the following command to create the identity provider:

```bash
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc myCluster \
  --location=global \
  --workload-identity-pool=${POOL_ID} \
  --display-name="Okteto Identity Provider" \
  --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub" \
  --issuer-uri="${OIDC_ENDPOINT}" \
  --allowed-audiences=${AUDIENCE}
```

### Step 3: Create the IAM Policy Binding

Now, grant the Okteto Kubernetes service account the permissions required to access the specified GCP resources.

First, retrieve the `PROJECT_ID` and `PROJECT_NUMBER` values from your Google Cloud project. You can get them by going to your [Project's settings in the Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/settings).

Next, set the following variables:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=myProject-123
export PROJECT_NUMBER=118593354781
export PRINCIPAL=iam.googleapis.com/projects/${PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${POOL_ID}/subject/${OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
```

Finally, run the following command to bind the appropriate IAM role to the service account:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --role=roles/storage.admin --member=principal://${PRINCIPAL} --condition=None
```

This grants the Okteto service account permission to access Cloud Storage resources.

## Step 4: Configure GCP Cloud Credentials in Okteto

Now that you've created the IAM Policy Binding, the final step is to configure the GCP credentials in Okteto.

Go to the [Cloud Credentials view](index.mdx) view in the Okteto Admin dashboard and enable the GCP Workload ID option:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/gcp-cloud-credentials.png").default}
    alt="GCP Workload ID"
  />
</p>

Provide the following information:

- **Project ID**: The GCP project id `PROJECT_ID` where the resources are located
- **Workload Identity Pool ID**: The Pool ID `POOL_ID` you created in Step 1
- **Provider ID**: The OIDC Provider ID created in Step 2
- **Audience JWT Claim**: The Audience `AUDIENCE` you specified during the Identity Provider setup

## Example Okteto Manifest

With the configuration complete, the following Okteto Manifest can interact with the specified storage buckets:


```yaml
deploy:
  image: gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:stable
  commands:
    - gcloud storage buckets create gs://test-bucket

test:
  gcp:
    image: gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:stable
    commands:
      - gcloud storage ls | grep test-bucket

destroy:
  image: gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:stable
  commands:
    - gcloud storage buckets delete gs://test-bucket
```
