This tutorial will guide you on how to use your private Google Artifact Registry with Okteto.
It's recommended that you have the [gcloud CLI installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to follow this tutorial.

The steps to configure your private Google Artifact Registry with Okteto are: 

- Create a service account with access to your private Google Artifact Registry
- Retrieve the service account credentials
- Configure the credentials in Okteto

## Step 1: Create a service account with access to your private Google Artifact Registry

Export the name your want to use for your service account:

```bash
export SA_NAME=<<your-service-account-name>>
```

Create a service account with the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/service-accounts/create) by executing the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${SA_NAME} --display-name="My Service Account for Okteto"
```

Add a policy to grant read access to your private Google Artifact Registry:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding {PROJECT_ID} \
    --member=serviceAccount:{SA_NAME}@{PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/artifactregistry.reader
```

## Step 2: Retrieve the service account credentials

Create an Access Key to use these credentials by executing the following command: 

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create SA_KEY_FILE.json \
    --iam-account=SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

The command will create a file `SA_KEY_FILE.json` with rhe required credentials. You will use this file in the next step.

## Step 3: Configure the credentials in Okteto

Add the following registry credentials to the [Admin Registry Credentials view](index.mdx#add-registry-credentials):

- **Type**: `Static`
- **Hostname**: your private Google Artifact Registry endpoint, for example `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev`
- **Username**: `_json_key`
- **Password**: the content of the file `SA_KEY_FILE.json``

You can also use `_json_key_base64` as `username` and encode your `SA_KEY_FILE.json` as the value of the `password`:

```bash
cat SA_KEY_FILE.json | base64
```
