This tutorial will guide you on how to use ECR private registry in Amazon Web Services with Okteto and how to configure its necessary credentials.
It's recommended that you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) for this configuration.

The steps to do it are: 

1. Create User with access to ECR
1. Get User Credentials
1. Okteto config with credentials
1. Add credentials to the Okteto Dashboard

## Step 1: Create User with access to ECR

Create IAM user with `aws cli` ([CLI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-user.html))

```
aws iam create-user --user-name private-registry-user

aws iam attach-user-policy \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly \
--user-name private-registry-user
```

Or, configure manually. Find the `IAM Service` in the **AWS Console,** and follow these steps:

- *Users → Create User*
- Add User *Name*
- Add *Policy Option*
- Search for *ContainerRegistry* (for this example I’m adding **ReadOnly**)
- Create User

:::info
It is recommended to use groups, and add the user and policy to that group

## Step 2: Get User credentials

Once we have the `User` created, we need to get *Security Credentials*.

Create IAM user access key with `aws cli` ([CLI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-access-key.html))

```
$ aws iam create-access-key --user-name private-registry-user
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "private-registry-user",
        "AccessKeyId": "{ACCESS_KEY}",
        "Status": "Active",
        "SecretAccessKey": "{PASSWORD}",
        "CreateDate": "2023-10-10T09:08:27+00:00"
    }
}
```

Or from the Console, just open the User and go to the tab: 

- In section *Access Keys → Create Access Key*
- Choose between type options (I’m going to use *Others*)
- Copy the **AccessKeyId** and **SecretAccessKey**

## Step 3: Okteto config with credentials

The access to the Private Registry in AWS is defined by: 

- **URL**: the default registry should be:
    - `https://{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.{REGION}.amazonaws.com`
- **user:`${AccessKeyId}`**
- **password:`${SecretAccessKey}`**

## Step 4: Add your credentials to the Okteto Admin Dashboard

Add your credentials to the admin dashboard [following these instructions](admin/registry-credentials/index.mdx) after signing into your Okteto instance
