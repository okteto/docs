This tutorial will guide you on how to use your private Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with Okteto.
It's recommended that you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) to follow this tutorial.

ECR credentials can be configured with either an IAM user or using OIDC federation.

# Using IAM User credentials

The steps to configure your private ECR with Okteto are: 

- Create a user with access to your private ECR
- Retrieve the user credentials
- Configure the credentials in Okteto

## Step 1: Create a user with access to your private ECR

Create IAM user with the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-user.html) by executing:

```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name private-registry-user
```

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly \
  --user-name private-registry-user
```

## Step 2: Retrieve the user credentials

Once we have the `User` created, we need to retrieve their credentials.
Create IAM user access key with the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-access-key.html) by executing:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name private-registry-user
```

```bash
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "private-registry-user",
        "AccessKeyId": "<<your-access-key>>",
        "Status": "Active",
        "SecretAccessKey": "<<your-password>>",
        "CreateDate": "2023-10-10T09:08:27+00:00"
    }
}
```

Remember the value of `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey`. You will need them in the next step.

## Step 3: Configure the credentials in Okteto

Add the following registry credentials to the [Admin Registry Credentials view](index.mdx#add-registry-credentials):

- **Type**: `AWS IAM User`
- **Hostname**: the default registry endpoint is `https://{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.{REGION}.amazonaws.com`
- **Username**: `AccessKeyId` from the previous step
- **Password**: `SecretAccessKey` from the previous step
