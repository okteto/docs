This tutorial will guide you on how to use your private Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with Okteto.
It's recommended that you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) to follow this tutorial.

ECR credentials can be configured with either static credentials belonging to an IAM user or using OIDC federation to assume an IAM Role via Web Identity.

## Using IAM User credentials

The steps to configure access to your private ECR using IAM User credentials are: 

- Create a user with access to your private ECR
- Retrieve the user credentials
- Configure the credentials in Okteto

### Step 1: Create a user with access to your private ECR

:::info
We recommend installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) before following this tutorial
:::


Create IAM user with the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-user.html) by executing:

```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name private-registry-user
```

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly \
  --user-name private-registry-user
```

### Step 2: Retrieve the user credentials

Once we have the `User` created, we need to retrieve their credentials.
Create IAM user access key with the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-access-key.html) by executing:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name private-registry-user
```

```yaml
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "private-registry-user",
        "AccessKeyId": "<<your-access-key>>",
        "Status": "Active",
        "SecretAccessKey": "<<your-password>>",
        "CreateDate": "2023-10-10T09:08:27+00:00"
    }
}
```

Remember the value of `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey`. You will need them in the next step.

### Step 3: Configure the credentials in Okteto

Add the following registry credentials to the [Admin Registry Credentials view](index.mdx#add-registry-credentials):

- **Type**: `AWS IAM User`
- **Hostname**: the default registry endpoint is `https://{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.{REGION}.amazonaws.com`
- **Username**: `AccessKeyId` from the previous step
- **Password**: `SecretAccessKey` from the previous step

## Using IAM Roles via OpenID Connect (OIDC) Federation

The steps to configure access to your private ECR using IAM Roles via OpenID Connect (OIDC) Federation are : 

- Register the Identity Provider
- Create the IAM Role and Grant Access to ECR
- Configure the credentials in Okteto

### Step 1: Register the Identity Provider

:::info
We recommend installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) before following this tutorial
:::

The first step in configuring access to your private ECR is to register your Kubernetes cluster as an OIDC identity provider in AWS.
To do this, Okteto provides the OIDC endpoint of your cluster, which can be found in the General section of your Okteto Admin Dashboard.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/amazon-ecr-oidc-config.png").default}
    alt="OIDC configuration in admin general view"
  />
</p>

Store these values as environment variables, you will use them in the next steps:

```bash
export OIDC_ENDPOINT=https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster
export OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=system:serviceaccount:okteto:okteto
```

The `AUDIENCE` is traditionally the client ID of the requester, and tokens will only be exchanged for these audiences.
It corresponds to the `aud` field in the JWT payload. We recommend creating a unique audience for each Okteto instance and AWS region.
For example:

```bash
export AUDIENCE=okteto.example.com/us-east-2
```

Next, run the following command to create the OIDC identity provider in AWS:


```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider --url "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}" --client-id-list "${AUDIENCE}"
```

Once successful, youâ€™ll see a response similar to:

```yaml
{
    "OpenIDConnectProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:oidc-provider/container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster"
}
```

Store this value in an environment variable, you'll use in the next step:

```bash
export ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::112233445566:oidc-provider/container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster
```

### Step 2: Create the IAM Role and Grant Access to ECR

In this step, you'll create an IAM Role that allows access to ECR and configure it to be assumed using the OIDC identity provider created in the previous.

First, create the trust policy that allows the IAM Role to be assumed by the OIDC identity provider.
Save the following content to a file named `trust-policy.json` (replace your environment variables):

```yaml title="trust-policy.json"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "${ROLE_ARN}"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:aud": "${AUDIENCE}",
          "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:sub": "${OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run the following command to create the IAM Role in AWS with the trust policy you defined:

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name my-private-registry --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

You will receive a response similar to this:

```yaml
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "my-private-registry",
        "RoleId": "AR...",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/my-private-registry",
        "CreateDate": "2024-06-10T15:04:05+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Now, attach an ECR policy to allow pulling from the registry:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name my-private-registry --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly
```

### Step 3: Configure the credentials in Okteto

Now that you've created the IAM Role, the final step is to configure the credentials in Okteto.

Go to the [Registry Credentials view](index.mdx) view in the Okteto Admin dashboard and provide the following information:

- **Type**: `AWS IAM Role`
- **Hostname**: The ECR registry endpoint is `https://{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.{REGION}.amazonaws.com`
- **Role ARN**: The Role ARN `ROLE_ARN` you created in Step 1
- **Audience**: The Audience `AUDIENCE` you specified during the Identity Provider setup
