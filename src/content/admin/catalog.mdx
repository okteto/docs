The **Catalog** feature allows `admins` to pre-configure a list of applications from the Okteto Admin Dashboard.
These applications are available to developers in the same Okteto instance when launching a development environment from the UI.
By using Catalog entries, developers can quickly deploy their environments without needing to manually configure Okteto manifests or set up environment variables.

This feature allows Okteto administrators to enhance the developer experience by streamlining workflows, making it easier for developers to begin their projects.

## Create your Catalog

:::info
_Only accounts with the administrator role can use this feature._
:::

Within the Okteto Dashboard, navigate to **Admin -> Catalog** under the Cluster Management section. On this page, click the `Add Repository` button to open the `Add Repository` form.

### Add an application to the Catalog

Completing this form adds an entry to your Catalog, which is basically a pre-defined application configuration that enables a developer to one-click deploy a development environment using that repository and the definition you’ve provided for it.

Fill out as much of the form that makes sense for you. You will see:

- Name\*
- Repository URL\*
- [Default Branch](#define-a-default-branch)
- [Manifest Path](#define-a-manifest-path)
- [Environment Variables](#add-environment-variables)

Only the `Name` and `Repository URL` fields are required. When done, click `Save`.

  />
</p>

### Define a Default Branch

The default branch you specify here will be the default branch used when a developer selects this Catalog item to deploy a development environment.

You can specify multiple Catalog entries for the same `Repository URL` and set a different `Default Branch` for each one if your use case necessitates that.

### Define a Manifest Path

This field should (optionally) point to where your Okteto manifest resides. This provides additional control to provide a smoother experience for developers who deploy a development environment from the Catalog.

### Add Environment Variables

You can also (optionally) add Environment Variables to your Catalog entry to standardize how the development environment is deployed. Similar to the Default Branch entry, you could specify multiple catalog entries for the same Repository URL each with different Environment Variables.

    width="800"
  />
</p>

## Deploy a Dev Environment from your Catalog

Once you’ve defined your Catalog entries, you can navigate to `Namespaces` → `Deploy Dev Environment` → `Catalog`.

In this section you should see all of the repositories you’ve added (and pre-configured). Select an entry you wish to use and click `Deploy`.

  />
</p>

<p align="center">
