# Catalog <TiersList tiers="Scale Enterprise Self-Hosted" />

The Catalog feature enables `admins` to pre-configure a list of applications, from the Okteto web UI, that are made available to `developers` in the same Okteto instance when they launch a dev environment from the UI. By pre-configuring these catalog entries, a developer can shorten the time it takes to deploy a development environment. With Catalog, developers don’t need to worry about using the right Okteto manifest or configuring the necessary environment variables.

This feature allows Okteto administrators to enhance the developer experience by streamlining workflows, making it easier for developers to begin their projects.

## Create your Catalog

:::info

_Only accounts with the administrator role can use this feature._

:::

Within the Okteto UI, navigate to the `Admin` page and select the `Catalog` tab. On this tab, click the `Add Repository` button to open the `Add Repository` form.

### Add an application to the catalog

Completing this form adds an entry to your Catalog, which is basically a pre-defined application configuration that enables a developer to one-click deploy a development environment using that repository and the definition you’ve provided for it.

Fill out as much of the form that makes sense for you. You will see:

- Name\*
- Repository URL\*
- [Default Branch](#define-a-default-branch)
- [Manifest Path](#define-a-manifest-path)
- [Environment Variables](#add-environment-variables)

Only the `Name` and `Repository URL` fields are required. When done, click `Save`.

    width="900"
  />
</p>

### Define a Default Branch

The default branch you specify here will be the default branch used when a developer selects this Catalog item to deploy a development environment.

You can specify multiple catalog entries for the same `Repository URL` and set a different `Default Branch` for each one if your use case necessitates that.

### Define a Manifest Path

This field should (optionally) point to where your Okteto manifest resides. This provides additional control to provide a smoother experience for developers who deploy a development environment from the Catalog.

### Add Environment Variables

You can also (optionally) add Environment Variables to your Catalog entry to standardize how the development environment is deployed. Similar to the Default Branch entry, you could specify multiple catalog entries for the same Repository URL each with different Environment Variables.

    src={require("@site/static/img/gc_add_env_vars.png").default}
    alt="add environment variables to Catalog repo"
    width="800"
  />
</p>

## Deploy a Dev Environment from your Catalog

Once you’ve defined your Catalog entries, you can navigate to `Namespaces` → `Deploy Dev Environment` → `Catalog`.

In this section you should see all of the repositories you’ve added (and pre-configured). Select an entry you wish to use and click `Deploy`.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/gc_deploy_dev_env-v1.17+.png").default}
    alt="Deploy a development environment from the Catalog"
    width="600"
  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/gc_deploy_view_env_vars-v1.17+.png").default}
    alt="view a Catalog repo's environment variables"
    width="600"
  />
</p>

## Manage Catalog using CRDs

You can also manage your [Catalog using CRDs](self-hosted/manage/crds.mdx#catalog-items).
This is useful, for example, if you want to have a default catalog on installation.

If you add catalog items using CRDs they will be displayed in the UI, but they can't be modified from the UI. If you want to manage them from the UI, they must be created from there.
