The **Catalog** feature allows `admins` to pre-configure a list of applications from the Okteto Admin Dashboard.
These applications are available to developers in the same Okteto instance when launching a development environment from the UI.
By using Catalog entries, developers can quickly deploy their environments without needing to manually configure Okteto manifests or set up environment variables.

This feature allows Okteto administrators to enhance the developer experience by streamlining workflows, making it easier for developers to begin their projects.

## Create your Catalog

:::info
_Only accounts with the administrator role can use this feature._
:::

You have two options for creating and managing Catalog items:
1. [Create Catalog items via the Dashboard](#create-and-manage-catalog-items-via-the-dashboard) or
1. [Create Catalog items using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](#create-and-manage-catalog-items-via-custom-resource-definitions-crds)

### Create and Manage Catalog Items via the Dashboard
Within the Okteto Dashboard, navigate to **Admin -> Catalog** under the Cluster Management section. On this page, click the `Add Repository` button to open the `Add Repository` form.

#### Add an application to the Catalog

Completing this form adds an entry to your Catalog, which is basically a pre-defined application configuration that enables a developer to one-click deploy a development environment using that repository and the definition you’ve provided for it.

Fill out as much of the form that makes sense for you. You will see:

- Name\*
- Repository URL\*
- [Default Branch](#define-a-default-branch)
- [Manifest Path](#define-a-manifest-path)
- [Environment Variables](#add-environment-variables)

Only the `Name` and `Repository URL` fields are required. When done, click `Save`.

    alt="Add a repository to the Catalog"
    width="900"
  />
</p>

#### Define a Default Branch

The default branch you specify here will be the default branch used when a developer selects this Catalog item to deploy a development environment.

You can specify multiple Catalog entries for the same `Repository URL` and set a different `Default Branch` for each one if your use case necessitates that.

#### Define a Manifest Path

This field should (optionally) point to where your Okteto manifest resides. This provides additional control to provide a smoother experience for developers who deploy a development environment from the Catalog.

#### Add Environment Variables

You can also (optionally) add Environment Variables to your Catalog entry to standardize how the development environment is deployed. Similar to the Default Branch entry, you could specify multiple catalog entries for the same Repository URL each with different Environment Variables.

    alt="Add environment variables to a Catalog repo"

  />
</p>

### Create and Manage Catalog Items via Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

You can also manage your [catalog using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](self-hosted/manage/crds.mdx#catalog-items) to configure and manage items programmatically.
This approach is particularly useful for teams leveraging GitOps workflows or automating deployments with tools like kubectl.
This approach can be useful if you'd like to have a default Catalog on installation.

Using CRDs for catalog items allows you to define configurations as code, which can then be applied to your cluster.
Once applied, these catalog items will appear in the Okteto UI, but they cannot be modified through the dashboard. If you prefer to manage Catalog items directly via the UI, you should create them there instead.

For detailed instructions on using CRDs in Okteto, including examples, refer to the [Custom Resource Definitions documentation](self-hosted/manage/crds.mdx#catalog-items).

## Deploy a Dev Environment from your Catalog

Once you’ve defined your Catalog entries, you can navigate to `Namespaces` → `Deploy Dev Environment` → `Catalog`.

In this section you should see all of the repositories you’ve added (and pre-configured). Select an entry you wish to use and click `Deploy`.
