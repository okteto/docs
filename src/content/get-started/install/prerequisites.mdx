Installing Okteto requires the following:

- A domain to use for the instance
- Access to add a wildcard DNS record to the domain
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of `kubectl`
- A working installation of `Helm` (v3)
- An Okteto License

### Domain

You'll need sufficient access to a [subdomain](get-started/configure/configuration-settings/#subdomain) to add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.
By default, all endpoints created by Okteto for your development environments will be exposed on the wildcard subdomain you choose.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow your cloud provider's Kubernetes cluster creation guide.
Okteto supports Kubernetes versions 1.24 through 1.26.

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.26
- A pool with at least 3 nodes with a minimum of 4CPUs and 16 GB of Memory
- 250 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.

### Installing kubectl

Follow the official Kubernetes documentation for [installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

Be sure to configure your kubectl to talk to your newly minted cluster.

### Installing Helm v3

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### License

You'll receive a license key as part of your subscription to Okteto. If you haven't received it, [please open a support ticket](https://okteto.com/support).
