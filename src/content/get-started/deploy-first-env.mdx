You configured the Okteto CLI to use your Okteto cluster in the [previous section](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx). In this section, you'll do the fun part: work on your application in a Development Environment.

## One Command To Rule Them All

`okteto up` is the focal point of the Okteto CLI experience and is a big part of what makes Okteto so easy to use.

In this guide you'll be fixing a bug in the Movies app. The application consists of:

- a React frontend
- a Node.js backend API
- a MongoDB database

The frontend uses the REST endpoints of the backend API and loads two different lists of movies based on its response. Ideally, the application looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies-fixed.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

But there is a bug in the backend code you need to fix to get to this working state 🙂. Let's fix it using an Okteto Development Environment.

Start by cloning the Movies app repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
$ cd movies-with-helm
```

Since the repo already has an [Okteto manifest](https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm/blob/main/okteto.yml), running `okteto up` will start your Development Environment:

```console
$ okteto up
```

You should see the deployed endpoints as part of the output in the CLI:

```console
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jul  4 11:15:16 2022
NAMESPACE: cindylopez
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindylopez.okteto.example.com/
  - https://movies-cindylopez.okteto.example.com/api
```

These endpoints are also shown in the Okteto UI:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-endpoints.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

Next, a prompt will ask for the microservice you want to develop.

```console
    Select the development container you want to activate:
    Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
  ▸ api
    frontend
```

Let's go with `api` because you know there's a bug there you need to fix 🙂

```console
 ✓  Development container 'api' selected
 ✓  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ✓  Images successfully pulled
 ✓  Files synchronized
    Context:   okteto.example.com
    Namespace: cindylopez
    Name:      api
    Forward:   9229 -> 9229

yarn run v1.22.19
$ nodemon server.js
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

You should be able to view your application when you visit this endpoint. Behind the scenes, Okteto will synchronize your changes to your Development Environment every time you save them locally.

## Development Time!

Visiting the frontend endpoint for the Movies app, something doesn't look right here, does it?

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

The list of movies is the same as Cindy's continue watching list. Let's fix that.

Open your favorite IDE on your local machine and edit line 43 in `/api/server.js` to:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Now save your changes. Okteto will automatically synchronize your changes to your Development Environment.
Take a look at the shell and notice how the changes are detected by [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Great, you can see your changes by simply refreshing the browser. This saves a ton of time!

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies-fixed.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You successfully developed your first application in an Okteto Development Environment.

In this Getting Started guide, we launched an Okteto Development Environment using a single command: `okteto up`.
After that, we fixed a bug in our Movies app taking advantage of a blazing fast feedback loop 🚀

From here, we recommend:

- Launching a Development Environment for your own application using this guide
- Reading about Okteto's [Preview Environments](preview/overview.mdx)
