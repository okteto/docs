In this guide you'll be fixing a bug in the Movies app. The application consists of:

- a React frontend
- a Node.js backend API
- a MongoDB database

The frontend uses the REST endpoints of the backend API and loads two different lists of movies based on its response.

Ideally, the application looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies-fixed.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Deploy the Movies app

Start by cloning the Movies app repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
$ cd movies-with-helm
```
The Movies app has an `okteto.yml` file with a `deploy` section the instructs Okteto how to deploy the app:

```yaml
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

Running `okteto deploy` will deploy the Movies app to Okteto:

```console
$ okteto deploy
```

```console
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jul  4 11:15:16 2022
NAMESPACE: okteto-admin
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-okteto-admin.localtest.me/
  - https://movies-okteto-admin.localtest.me/api
```

You will see the Movies app endpoints as part of the output of this command.
These endpoints are also shown in the Okteto UI:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-endpoints.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

This is how the Movies app looks like in your Development Environment:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/deploy-movies-app.png").default}
    alt="Movies app architecture"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Activate your Development Container

`okteto up` is the focal point of the Okteto CLI experience and is a big part of what makes Okteto so easy to use.

Run the following command to activate your Development Container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

Next, a prompt will ask for the microservice you want to develop.

```console
    Select the development container you want to activate:
    Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
  ▸ api
    frontend
```

Let's go with **api** because you know there's a bug there you need to fix 🙂

```console
 ✓  Development container 'api' selected
 ✓  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ✓  Images successfully pulled
 ✓  Files synchronized
    Context:   okteto.localtest.me
    Namespace: okteto-admin
    Name:      api
    Forward:   9229 -> 9229

yarn run v1.22.19
$ nodemon server.js
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

You should be able to view your application when you visit its endpoint. Behind the scenes, Okteto will synchronize your changes to your Development Container every time you save them locally.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/develop-movies-app.png").default}
    alt="Movies app architecture"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Development Time!

Visiting the frontend endpoint for the Movies app, something doesn't look right:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

The list of **Movies** and **Continue Watching for Cindy** is the same. Let's fix that!

Open your favorite IDE on your local machine and edit line 43 in `/api/server.js` to:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Now save your changes. Okteto will automatically synchronize your changes to your Development Container.
Take a look at the shell and notice how the changes are detected by [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required 😎!

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies-fixed.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the Movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>
