In this step you will learn how to expose your application using Okteto Endpoints.

In order to create endpoints for your application, you need to add the following annotation to your [Ingress](https://github.com/okteto/movies/blob/main/chart/templates/ingress.yaml) resource:

```yaml
annotations:
  dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
```

The Ingress object, located in the file `chart/templates/ingress.yaml`, will look like this after this change:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: movies
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: api
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

This instructs Okteto to create an endpoint in the [Okteto Subdomain](reference/helm-chart-values.mdx#subdomain).
For example, if your Ingress name is `movies` in the `cindy` namespace, your app will be accessible at https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com if your Okteto domain is okteto.example.com.

Deploy the Movies app to apply the changes:

```console
okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com/api
 ✓  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

Notice how the endpoints are shown by the Okteto CLI. You can also see the endpoints from the Okteto UI:

## Next Steps

Looks like there are still an issue with the Movies app. If you check the logs of the **api** Kubernetes Deployment:

```console
okteto logs api
```

```
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
+ api-646fdf88d6-267sn › api
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api yarn run v1.22.19
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api $ nodemon server.js
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api [nodemon] 2.0.4
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api [nodemon] starting `node server.js`
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api Error connecting, retrying in 1 sec: MongoServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mongodb
api-646fdf88d6-267sn api Error connecting, retrying in 1 sec: MongoServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mongodb
...
```

You can see that the **api** is failing to connect to MongoDB... Let's fix that in the [next step](dependencies.mdx) of this guide!
