The Movies app requires an instance of MongoDB to be running in your Development Environment.

You could deploy MongoDB as part of your `deploy` section in the `okteto.yaml` file, but in this case, you are going to use the repo https://github.com/okteto/mongodb as a dependency.
This repo is already pre-configured with a Docker Compose file to deploy MongoDB in Okteto.

To instruct Okteto to deploy this repository in your Development Environment, add the following section to your `okteto.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mongodb:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/mongodb
    wait: true
```

The `wait` flag instructs Okteto to wait until MongoDB is ready before running the deploy commands.
Deploy the Movies app to apply the changes:

```console
okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Deploying dependency 'mongodb'
 ...
 âœ“  Repository 'mongodb' successfully deployed
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com/api
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

You can see that MongoDB is now running from the Okteto UI:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/movies-mongodb-ui.png").default}
  alt="Movies Onboard MongoDB"
  width="850"
/>

### Using variables to set runtime configurations

But it looks like the **api** Deployment is still unable to connect to MongoDB...

Note that the file `chart/values.yaml` has a password hardcoded.
This won't probably be compliant with your security practices and is for example only.

Also, the default MongoDB password is `password` instead of `change-me!`. Luckily, you can pass runtime configuration to your Development Environment using [Okteto Variables](manifest/okteto-variables.mdx).
For example, you can define a local environment variable to configure the MongoDB password:

```console
export MONGODB_PASSWORD=password
```

Or even better, create an [Okteto Admin Variable](admin/dashboard.mdx#variables) to make this variable available across all your Development Environments in Okteto.

Once you have done this, update your `okteto.yaml` file to configure the MongoDB password using this environment variable.
You should also enable the `seed` job to load the MongoDB instance with initial data:

```yaml
deploy:
  - name: Helm Install
    command: |
      helm upgrade --install movies chart \
        --set mongodb.password=${MONGODB_PASSWORD} \
        --set seed.enabled=true
```

:::note
Running seed data scripts can be slow with real world databases. For those scenarios, you can use our [Volume Snapshots](core/components/use-volume-snapshots.mdx) feature to clone this data from an existing database in seconds ðŸš€

Deploy the Movies app to apply the changes:

```console
okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com/api
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

Finally, you can access the endpoint of the Movies app to see something like this:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Next Steps

The Movies app is using pre-built images to deploy your Development Environment...

This is not ideal since you won't be able to deploy your local changes, let's [build the images of the Movies app](build.mdx) in next step of this guide ðŸ˜Ž
