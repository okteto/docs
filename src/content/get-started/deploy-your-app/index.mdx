This guide explains how to deploy your first app to Okteto.

## Requirements

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you fulfill the following requirements:

- You have access to an Okteto instance. Otherwise, follow our [installation guide](get-started/install/index.mdx)
- You have [installed the Okteto CLI](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) and configured the Okteto Context with your Okteto instance

## What you will be building

This tutorial will guide you on how to deploy the [Movies app](https://github.com/okteto/getting-started) to Okteto. The Movies app consists of:

- a React frontend
- a Node.js backend API
- a MongoDB database

This is a representation of the Movies app running in a Development Environment:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/deploy-movies-app.png").default}
    alt="Movies app architecture"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

In order to deploy the Movies app, you will create your first [Okteto Manifest](core/okteto-manifest.mdx).
This is what your Okteto Manifest will look like at the end of the tutorial:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
build:
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend

dependencies:
  mongodb:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/mongodb
    wait: true
    variables:
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: password    

deploy:
  - name: Helm Install
    command: |
      helm upgrade --install movies chart \
        --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} \
        --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

This guide will take you through the following sections:

- `deploy`: Configure a list of commands to deploy your application
- `dependencies`: Configure a list of git repositories to deploy as part of your application
- `build`: Configure a list of images to build for your application

Now that you know what your are building, [start the tutorial](deploy.mdx) and deploy your app to Okteto ðŸ˜Ž
