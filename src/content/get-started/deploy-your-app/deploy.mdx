For this tutorial, you will be using our getting started sample app. Start by cloning the following repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/okteto/getting-started
cd getting-started
```

The Movies app comes with a Helm chart to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
To instruct Okteto to deploy the Movies app, create an `okteto.yaml` file at the root of the repo with the following content:

```yaml
name: movies
deploy:
  - name: Helm Install
    command: helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

The meaning of these fields is:

- `name`: it's the name of your development environment
- `deploy`: it's a list of commands to deploy your application. Every command has the following fields:
  - `name`: a name to label your command
  - `command`: the command to be executed

Now deploy the Movies app by running the following command:

```console
okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.sample.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  There are no available endpoints for 'movies'.
    Follow this link to know more about how to create public endpoints for your application:
    https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/ingress/automatic-ssl
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

Confirm that the Movies app is up and running by logging into the Okteto UI:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/movies-deploy-ui.png").default}
  alt="Movies Onboard Deploy"
  width="850"
/>

Or by configuring your Kubernetes credentials to access your Development Environment:

```console
okteto kubeconfig
```

```
Updated kubernetes context 'okteto_example_com/cindy' in '[/Users/cindy/.kube/config]'
```

And using `kubectl` to visualize how your Development Environment looks in Kubernetes:

```console
kubectl get all
```

```

## Next Steps

Awesome, you have deployed the Movies app to Okteto ðŸš€

But the Okteto CLI is informing us that `There are no available endpoints for 'movies'`...

Let's fix that in the [next step](endpoints.mdx) of this guide!
