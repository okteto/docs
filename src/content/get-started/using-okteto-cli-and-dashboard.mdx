The Okteto CLI is our [open-source](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) tool that let's you develop your applications on Okteto.
If you haven't done so yet, install and configure the Okteto CLI following [this guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx).

Most developers interact with okteto via the Command Line Interface (CLI). Here we‚Äôll explain common CLI commands and a typical workflow for using them.

## Essential Okteto CLI Commands

| CLI Command        | Description                                                                                                                                                       |

## Overview of the Okteto Dashboard

### 1. **Your Personal Namespace**

  Automatically generated for each user, this Personal Namespace is uniquely named after your username or email, ensuring a personalized environment. These cannot be deleted, but their resources can be destroyed allowing the Personal Namespace to be reused.

         src={require('@site/static/img/namespace-landing.jpg').default}
         alt="Okteto Namespace Landing Page"
         width="800"
      />
   </p>

### 2. **Using the Catalog to Deploy a Development Environment**

   The most common way to deploy a Development Environment on Okteto is through the Catalog. The Catalog is a list of your applications, configured by a platform engineer on your team, with everything the application needs to run included. You can find the Catalog by clicking on the ‚ÄúDeploy a Dev Environment‚Äù button.

   <p align="center">
      <Image
         src={require('@site/static/img/catalog-deployment.jpg').default}
         alt="Okteto Namespace Landing Page"
         width="800"
      />
   </p>

   You can also deploy a Development Environment with the following methods:

   - **Git Repository:** Deploy from a repository in a connected GitHub account
   - **URL**: Deploy from a specific Git URL

### 3. **Creating a New Namespace**

   To create a Namespace, go to the Okteto dashboard, click on your Namespace on the left, and at the bottom of the namespace list select (+) New Namespace.
   <p align="center">
     <Image
        src={require("@site/static/img/new-namespace.png").default}
        alt="new namespace dialog"
        width="800"
     />
   </p>

   Namespaces can also be created with by using the [`okteto namespace create` CLI Command](reference/okteto-cli.mdx#create)
   
   - **Non-Personal Namespaces** are additional Namespaces created by users or through automation, facilitating broader project collaboration and management. They may be deleted or transferred to other users.
   - As a common practice, you might name your Namespace based on a feature number, ticket number, or a similar identifier. Development environments within these Namespaces are created from Git branches. This allows you to run multiple Namespaces simultaneously, each corresponding to a different branch or feature.

### 4. **Sharing a Namespace**

   - Collaborate on several applications at once by sharing your namespace
   - To share a Namespace go to the Okteto dashboard, select the namespace you want to share and press the `Share` button in the namespace menu (you'll find it in the main bar at the top).

   <p align="center">
      <Image
         src={require('@site/static/img/sharing-a-namespace.jpg').default}
         alt="Okteto Namespace Landing Page"
         width="800"
      />
   </p>

   Read more about [sharing a Namespace here](core/namespaces.mdx#sharing-and-collaboration-with-namespaces)

### 5. **Environment States**
   - **Sleep**: Suspend your environment to save resources, the Okteto Garbage collector configured by your Okteto admin will set the sleep periods after a certain amount of inactivity
   - **Destroy All**: Remove all resources in a Namespace
   - **Keep Awake**: Admins can choose to prevent Namespaces from sleeping so that they are always accessible

### 6. **Preview Environments**

   - Temporary environments for testing features before merging into the main branch. These are a great way to share your changes with a QA Team or Product Manager
   - Okteto Admins can configure Previews to work with your source control and CI/CD provider so that a Preview links are automatically added to submitted pull requests

   <p align="center">
      <Image
         src={require('@site/static/img/preview-environments.jpg').default}
         alt="Okteto Namespace Landing Page"
         width="800"
      />
   </p>
