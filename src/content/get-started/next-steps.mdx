Congratulations! You successfully completed our getting started guide ðŸš€

Okteto lets you develop your applications directly on Kubernetes. This way you can:

- Accelerate the onboarding of new developers by reducing local setup dependencies
- Eliminate integration issues by developing on a production-like environment running on Kubernetes
- Test and debug your application end to end as fast as you type code
- No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Develop at the speed of the cloud!

From here, we recommend:

- Follow our [cloud provider guides](get-started/cloud-provider-guides/index.mdx) to complete your Okteto installation
- Read our step by step [tutorial to deploy your own application](deploy-your-app/index.mdx) to Okteto
