Congratulations! You successfully completed our getting started guide ðŸš€

Okteto lets you develop your applications directly on Kubernetes. This way you can:

- Accelerate the onboarding of new developers by reducing local setup dependencies
- Eliminate integration issues by developing on a production-like environment running on Kubernetes
- Test your application end to end as fast as you type code with Development Containers
- No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Develop at the speed of the cloud!

From here, we recommend:

- Complete your Okteto installation following our cloud provider guides (TODO: add link)
- Onboard your own application to Okteto using this guide (TODO: add link)
