# Welcome to Okteto Test

Okteto Test is a new feature designed to seamlessly integrate testing into your development workflow on the Okteto platform. Whether you're running unit tests or end-to-end (E2E) tests, Okteto Test ensures an efficient testing experience before even making a pull request.

## Benefits of Okteto Test

### 1. Seamless Integration
Developers can execute tests in the same production-like Kubernetes environment where their code runs.
This ensures consistency and reduces configuration overhead.

### 2. Simplified Configuration
The new `test` section in the [Okteto manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#test-object-optional) supports multiple Test Containers, allowing you to define your test environment with minimal YAML configuration.
This eliminates the need for complex setups and advanced Kubernetes knowledge.

### 3. Faster Feedback Loop
Okteto Test leverages Buildkit's built-in capabilities to run only the tests affected by code changes.
You can quickly identify and fix issues, especially in monorepos, significantly reducing the feedback loop for a development cycle.


## Getting Started with Okteto Test

View our [Getting Started with Okteto Test Guide](testing/getting-started-test.mdx) to learn how to configure Test Containers.

### Okteto Test Basics

#### 1. Adding Tests to Your Okteto Manifest
To get started, add a new test section to your Okteto manifest. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

``` yaml
test:
  unit:
    image: ${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE}
    command: make test
  e2e:
    image: ${OKTETO_BUILD_TEST_IMAGE}
    command: make e2e
    depends_on:
      - unit
```

#### 2. Running Tests
Use the okteto test command to run your tests. The command will execute all test containers defined in the manifest:

``` bash
okteto test
```
To run a specific test container, specify its name:

``` bash
okteto test e2e
```
You can also override the default command and environment variables at runtime using the --command and --var flags.

#### 3. Optimizing Test Execution
Okteto Test is smart about test execution and will reuse the build cache to avoid redundant computations. If you need to force a fresh execution, use the --no-cache flag:

``` bash
okteto test --no-cache
```
