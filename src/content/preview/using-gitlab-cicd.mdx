This section will show you how to automatically create a preview environment for your applications using Okteto and GitLab's review apps.

## Pre-Requisites
- An Okteto account
- A [GitLab Account](https://gitlab.com)

For this tutorial, we'll be using our sample [movies rental application](https://gitlab.com/okteto/preview-environments). If you're using your own application to follow along, please ensure you have your [Okteto Manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx) configured.

## Step 1: Configure your Okteto API Token

To deploy a preview environment with Okteto, you need to define the following environment variables:

1. `OKTETO_TOKEN`: an Okteto [personal access token](core/credentials/personal-access-tokens.mdx).
1. [Optional] `OKTETO_URL`: Specify the URL of your Okteto instance (e.g., https://okteto.example.com). If empty, it will default to https://cloud.okteto.com.

To add the environment variables:

1. Navigate to your GitLab repository.
1. Go to the **Settings** menu on the left, and click on the **CI/CD** entry.

1. Expand the **Variables** section, and click on the **Add Variable** button.
<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/gitlab-settings-cicd-add-variables.png" alt="GitLab settings, add variables" /></p>

1. Add *OKTETO_TOKEN* as the key, and your personal access token as the value, and press the *Add Variable* button.
<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/gitlab-settings-cicd-add-variables-okteto-token.png" alt="update variable with Okteto Token" /></p>
1. Repeat the same process to add the *OKTETO_URL* variables (optional)

## Step 2: Configure the Preview Environment on the Repository

To tell GitLab how to deploy our preview environment, you need to create a file named [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html) file at the root of the repository.

In this file, we'll define two jobs. The `review` creates a preview environment for every branch and a `stop-review` job to destroy it when merging or deleting the branch.

The flow to create a preview environment looks like this:

1. Create a dedicated namespace for the Preview Environment
1. Build and deploy the application using the [Okteto preview](preview/overview.mdx) defined in the repository.
1. Add the URL of the Preview Environment to the Merge Request.

The flow to delete a preview environment looks like this:

1. Destroy the application deployed with the [Okteto preview](preview/overview.mdx)


The `.gitlab-ci.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
# file: .gitlab.ci.yml
image: okteto/okteto:2.18.0

stages:
  - review

review:
  stage: review
  variables:
    APP: review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  script:
    - okteto preview deploy review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG --scope global --branch $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME --repository $CI_REPOSITORY_URL --wait

  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    url: https://movies-review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG.okteto.example.com
    on_stop: stop-review
  only:
    - branches
  except:
    - master

stop-review:
  stage: review
  when: manual
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    action: stop
  script:
     - okteto preview destroy review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  only:
    - branches
  except:
    - master
```

There are two scopes for preview environments, `personal`, where the only one who has access to the environment is the user, and `global`, where all cluster members have access to it and do not need to have the user's name at the end of the preview environment name. To create a preview environment with global scope it is necessary to have administrator permissions.

A few recommendations when creating your preview environment:
- Create a preview environment per branch/merge request to keep things isolated. We use a preview and `$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG` in the name to ensure the namespace is unique and that we only create one per branch.
- Pass the URL of your preview environment using the `environment.url` key. That way, the reviewers can directly go to the preview environment from GitLab.
- Delete both the preview environment, and the namespace when the branch is deleted to cut down on manual deletion.

## Step 3: Create a Merge Request

Once your changes are in your repository, make a small code change and create a new merge request.

After a few seconds, the workflow will update the pull request with the URL of your preview environment. Click on the *View App* button, access it, and see your changes running.

## Step 4: Cleanup

Merging the merge request or deleting the branch automatically triggers the `stop-review` job we defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The `stop-review` job will destroy the preview environment automatically for you.

##  Configure your GitLab Runner in Okteto

Okteto makes it easy to deploy your own [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) from the [Okteto Catalog](deploy/launch-from-catalog.mdx). Running your runners is useful if you find yourself constantly waiting for shared runners to be available or want to run more complex configurations.

### Retrieve the Registration Information

1. Navigate to your GitLab repository.
1. Go to the **Settings** menu on the left, and click on the **CI/CD** entry.
<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/gitlab-settings-cicd.png" alt="settings for GitLab" /></p>
1. Expand the **Runners** section, and copy the URL and registration tokens.

### Deploy your GitLab Runner

1. Log in using your Okteto account.
1. Click on the **Deploy** button on the top.
1. Choose **Catalog** as the source, select **gitlab-runner** from the options below, and click **Deploy**.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/gitlab-deploy-runner.png" width="600" alt="GitLab deploy runner" /></p>

1. On the **configuration** section, add your runner registration token to the `runnerRegistrationToken` key.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/gitlab-deploy-runner-configuration.png" width="500" alt="GitLab deploy runner configuration" /></p>

1. [Optional] If you're running your own GitLab instance, also update the value of `gitlabUrl`.
1. Press the **Deploy** button.

In a few seconds, your GitLab Runner will be deployed and registered with your repository. To validate this, go back to the **Runners** section on your repository's settings, and validate that the runner is available there.
