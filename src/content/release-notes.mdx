### Breaking Changes

Okteto requires you to use a valid license as part of the installation. If you were running a previous version of Okteto and you don't have a valid license, signup for our [30 day free trial](https://www.okteto.com/free-trial/) or [reach out to us](https://www.okteto.com/contact/).
