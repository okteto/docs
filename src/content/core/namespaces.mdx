Namespaces in Okteto offer a flexible way to organize your Development Environments. A Namespace can last for a few weeks for developing a feature, or a couple days for a bug fix.
Not only do Namespaces give you an individual separation of context while you are working, but you can also use shared Namespaces to collaborate with you team before anyone pushes to git.

In Okteto, Namespaces are categorized into two types:

- **Personal Namespace**: Automatically generated for each user, this Namespace is uniquely named after the user's username or email, ensuring a personalized environment. These cannot be deleted, but their resources can be destroyed allowing the Namespace to be reused.
- **Non-Personal Namespaces**: These are additional Namespaces created by users or through automation, facilitating broader project collaboration and management. They may be deleted or transferred to other users.

With the Okteto Dashboard you can create, launch, and manage secure and isolated Namespaces for you and your team.

## Manage your Namespaces

To create a Namespace, go to the Okteto dashboard, click on your Namespace on the left, and at the bottom of the namespace list select (+) New Namespace.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/new-namespace.png").default}
    alt="new namespace dialog"
    width="800"
  />
</p>

As a common pattern, you might name your Namespace by feature number, ticket number, or something similar.
Development Environments in Namespaces are pulled from git branches, which is why you may want to be running multiple at the same time.


The Okteto Dashboard allows you to easily create, sleep, and wake up your Namespaces with a simple click. Specifically, you can use the Sleep and Wake dialogs for controlling your Namespace's state.

If you prefer to use the command line, here are the Namespace management options available:

- Create a namespace with `okteto namespace create`
- Set your kubectl configuration to use your namespace with `okteto kubeconfig`
- Delete a non-personal namespace using `okteto namespace delete`
- Sleep or wake up your namespace with `okteto namespace sleep [name]` and `okteto namespace wake [name]` commands respectively

:::tip
Administrators can specify a global, default threshold for automatically sleeping a namespace in the [garbage collection](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#gc) configuration.

## Sharing and Collaboration with Namespaces

By default, you'll be the only person with access to your Namespaces. Invite your teammates to enable true real-time collaboration.
Each user is able to collaborate together on an application within a Development Environment all before any code is ever pushed. Test better together.

To share a Namespace go to the Okteto dashboard, select the namespace you want to share and press the `Share` button in the namespace menu (you'll find it in the main bar at the top).

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/share.png").default}
    alt="share a namespace"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

In the `Share` dialog, type the email address of the team members you want to share this namespace with. Once you press save, Okteto will update the necessary permissions and notify your teammates via email.


## Namespace administration

The Okteto platform will take care of all the required RBAC roles and bindings, resources [quotas](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#quotas) and limits, and [network policies](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#networkpolicies) so everyone in your team can safely deploy and develop applications in Kubernetes.


### Transfer Namespace ownership

Okteto administrators have the ability to transfer non-personal Namespaces between users. This process can be achieved through the Okteto UI and can be helpful for when you need to manually remove resources from an inactive user.

To transfer a Namespace to a new owner, go to the Okteto UI -> Admin -> Namespaces then locate the Namespace that you would like to transfer. Click on the three dots `...` to display the Namespace menu. From the Namespace menu select `Transfer Ownership`.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/namespace-transfer-owner.png").default}
    alt="transfer a Namespace"
    width="650"
  />
</p>

When the Transfer Ownership modal appears, type the email address of the team member who you'd like the transfer the Namespace to. Once you press confirm, ownership of that Namespace will be immediately transferred.
If you wish, you can keep the current owner as a member of the Namespace by selecting the option in the Transfer Ownership modal. If this is not selected the current owner will immediately lose access.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/namespace-transfer-modal.png").default}
    alt="Select a new Namespace owner"
    width="700"
  />
</p>

:::note
User specific variables will not transfer along with a Namespace. If the Namespace being transferred has user specific variables, please note that future build or destroy actions may fail.

New user specific variables can be added to a transferred Namespace if desired to avoid future failures. Details on [adding variables can be found here](core/okteto-variables.mdx).

### Garbage collection settings

The Okteto Garbage Collector service can automatically scale down idle applications and delete unused namespaces for optimal cost savings and resource management.

Please see our [resource cleanup guide](admin/cleanup.mdx) to see the management options available and how to configure them.
