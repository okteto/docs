When working on applications, effective collaboration is crucial. Preview environments streamline the review process by generating a shareable URL for every pull request, allowing all stakeholders to review changes before they are merged into the main branch. These environments are deployed automatically, enabling faster feedback cycles and preventing the review process from being limited to developers.

## Benefits of Preview Environments

- Improved Collaboration: Every pull request generates a preview environment, allowing team members to easily access and review changes via a unique URL. This makes collaboration seamless across various teams, such as sales, marketing, and design, without requiring changes to be pushed to production.

- Faster Feedback: With preview URLs, stakeholders can provide feedback earlier in the development process. This reduces bottlenecks and ensures that issues are caught before changes reach production.

- Accessible to Everyone: Preview environments open up the review process to non-developers such as product owners, designers, and other stakeholders, making it easy to ensure alignment across teams before merging code.

## How to Use Preview Environments

Once your company's platform team has [configured Preview Environments](previews/index.mdx) for your repositories, using them is really simple:

1. Create a Pull Request: Every time a developer submits a pull request, a preview environment is automatically generated.

1. Share the URL: Once the preview environment is deployed, a unique URL is provided. This URL can be shared with anyone who needs to review the changes. You can find this link in the pull request description or CI/CD logs.

1. Review the Changes: The preview environment hosts a fully functional instance of your application. Use this instance to interact with the changes and perform thorough testing. Stakeholders from various departments can access the application via the shared URL and provide feedback.

1. Merge or Iterate: Once the changes are approved, the code can be merged into the main branch. If further feedback is provided, iterate on the changes, which will update the preview environment until the pull request is ready to be merged.

## Best Practices

1. Involve Stakeholders Early: Don’t wait until code is in production. Share preview URLs with team members across different functions (marketing, design, product, etc.) early in the development cycle to gather feedback and catch issues earlier.

1. Test Thoroughly: Use the preview environment to run all necessary tests, ensuring that any potential bugs or issues are caught before merging the code.

1. Keep Feedback Cycles Short: Since preview environments are instantly available with every pull request, it’s a great opportunity to speed up the review cycle. Make sure to gather feedback promptly and make necessary changes in a timely manner.

By integrating preview environments into your workflow, your team can reduce friction, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.
