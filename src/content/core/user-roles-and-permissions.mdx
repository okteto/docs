The Okteto platform offers a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage and control access to different environments within the platform.
This page outlines the roles, permissions, and key features available to Admins and Developers in Okteto.

## User Roles

In Okteto, there are two primary roles: **Admins** and **Developers**. These roles were previously known as “Admin” and “User,” but we have updated the terminology for clarity and consistency across our platform.

## Admins

Admins have extensive control and oversight capabilities across the Okteto platform. Key features include:

### Admin Access to Any Namespace
Admins can access any Namespace, allowing them to:
- Deploy and remove Development Environments
- Redeploy Development Environments
- Remove Namespaces entirely

**Benefits**: This level of access allows admins to manage and troubleshoot environments, even if the original owner is unavailable.

### Transferring Namespace Ownership
Admins can [reassign the owner of a non-personal namespace](core/namespaces.mdx#transfer-namespace-ownership) to another user.

**Benefits**: This provides flexibility in managing user and resource changes, such as team restructuring or personnel off time.

### Full Control Over Environments
Admins can perform all operations on any Namespace or Preview Environment, including:
- Deleting, sharing, waking, sleeping, and marking namespaces/previews as persistent
- Deploying or deleting applications using both Okteto and `kubectl`
- Accessing all resources and sub-resources within any Development Environment

## Developers

Developers, previously known as “Users,” have permissions primarily focused on creating and managing their own environments. Key features include:

### Creating and Managing Environments
Developers can:
- Create Namespaces and Personal/Global Preview Environments
- Delete Namespaces and Preview Environments they own
- Share Namespaces and Preview Environments they own
- Deploy applications using both Okteto and `kubectl` within their own or shared Namespaces and Previews Environments
- Wake and sleep namespaces and previews they own or have access to

### Access to Global Previews
Developers have read access to Global Preview Environments, enabling them to troubleshoot issues effectively using `kubectl`.

**Benefits**: This feature allows developers' to monitor and debug shared environments without requiring elevated permissions.
