The Okteto platform offers a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage and control access to different environments within the platform.
This page outlines the roles, permissions, and key features available to Admins and Developers in Okteto.

## User Roles

In Okteto, there are two primary roles: **Admins** and **Developers**.

## Admins

Admins have extensive control and oversight capabilities across the Okteto platform. Key features include:

### Admin Access to Any Environment
Admins can perform all operations on any Namespace or Preview Environment, including:
- Deleting, sharing, waking, sleeping, and marking Namespaces or Preview Environments as persistent
- Deploying or deleting applications using both Okteto and `kubectl`
- Accessing all resources and sub-resources within any Development Environment
- [Transferring Namespace ownership](core/namespaces.mdx#transfer-namespace-ownership) between developers
- Fine tuning Developer access to Namespaces and Preview Environments by configuring [the `serviceAccounts` section within the Okteto Helm configuration](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#serviceaccounts).


**Benefits**: This level of access allows admins to manage and troubleshoot environments, even if the original owner is unavailable.

## Access to the Okteto Admin Dashboard
Admins can manage their instance through the [Okteto Admin Dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx), including:
- [Managing all users](admin/dashboard.mdx#users) within their Okteto instance
- Having an overview of [Kubernetes Node utilization](admin/dashboard.mdx#nodes)
- Seeing and managing all [Namespaces and Preview Environments](admin/dashboard.mdx#namespaces) within their Okteto instance
- Setting cluster-wide variables in the [Admin Variables section](admin/dashboard.mdx#admin-variables)
- Configuring [Admin Access Tokens](admin/dashboard.mdx#admin-access-tokens) for shared automations
- Creating a library of ready-to-use Environments in the [Catalog](admin/catalog.mdx)


## Developers

Developers have permissions primarily focused on creating and managing their own environments. Key features include:

### Creating and Managing Environments
Developers can:
- Create Namespaces and Personal/Global Preview Environments
- Delete Namespaces and Preview Environments they own
- Share Namespaces and Preview Environments they own
- Deploy applications using both Okteto and `kubectl` within their own or shared Namespaces and Previews Environments
- Wake and sleep Namespaces and Preview Environments they own or have access to

### Access to Global Preview Environments
Developers have read access to Global Preview Environments, enabling them to troubleshoot issues effectively using `kubectl`.

**Benefits**: This feature allows developers to monitor and debug shared environments without requiring elevated permissions.
