## Auto create ingresses from services

Okteto can automatically create an SSL endpoint for your deployments. In order to take advantage of this feature, add the annotation below to your service's manifest:

```yaml
  dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress: "true"
```

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  labels:
    app: hello-world
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress: "true"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-world
```

:::tip

A sample of how this should look [is available here](https://github.com/okteto/go-getting-started/blob/master/k8s.yml#L26).

:::

Adding this annotation will tell Okteto to automatically create an https ingress rule for you that redirects to the first http port of your service.

`NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` services are managed as if they had this annotation too. You can disable this behaviour by setting [`convertLoadBalancedServices.enabled`](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#convertloadbalancedservices) to `false`.

You can see the address of your endpoint by going to the Okteto dashboard or by running the `okteto endpoints` command. The endpoint address will be consistent across redeploys, as long as you don't change your service name.

## Bring your own ingress

You can also use your own ingress manifests. This is useful when you have more complex configurations, or you need specific URLs.

Keep in mind that all the hosts you use in your ingress must end with`-$NAMESPACE.okteto.example.com`.

### Let Okteto generate the host

Okteto can automatically inject the right host names during the creation of your ingresses, while leaving the rest of the configuration intact. In order to take advantage of this feature, add the annotation below to your ingress' manifest.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
```

Full example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
  name: hello-world
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: hello-world
          servicePort: 8080
        path: /
```

We recommend you follow this option. This way your ingress configuration can be deployed on any namespace managed by Okteto.

## Customizing the endpoints shown in the Okteto dashboard

Okteto provides additional annotations that enable you to customize the endpoints shown in the Okteto dashboard.

To hide specific endpoints from the Okteto dashboard, you can use the `dev.okteto.com/hide-from-ui: true` annotation.
Simply apply this annotation to your `Ingress` or `VirtualService` resource, and the endpoints associated with that resource will not be displayed in the Okteto dashboard.

If you want to replace the default endpoints for an `Ingress` or `VirtualService` resource, you can use the `dev.okteto.com/endpoints` annotation.
This annotation allows you to define a list of endpoints, separated by commas, that will replace the default endpoints.
Additionally, the value of this annotation expands the `OKTETO_NAMESPACE` and `OKTETO_DOMAIN` environment variables, providing an easy way to make your endpoints portable between namespaces.

## Expose HTTPS Backends Through Ingress

If your application communicates over HTTPS instead of HTTP, you'll need to create a dedicated ingress, as demonstrated in the [Bring Your Own Ingress](#bring-your-own-ingress) section, and add the following annotation to it:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```

Please note that this won't pass through the certificate served by your application to the requester. Instead, the wildcard certificate of the Okteto instance will be used.
