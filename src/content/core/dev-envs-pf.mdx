Development environments are predefined setups that allow developers to start coding without the hassle of manual configuration. As a platform engineer, you can streamline the development process by providing standardized and trusted environments that developers can launch with a single click. This eliminates the need for developers to configure settings manually and enables them to focus on delivering features and value to customers.

By configuring development environments in advance, you ensure consistency across your team, improve developer productivity, and maintain control over the infrastructure and tools being used.

## Key Concepts for Configuring Development Environments

To effectively set up and manage development environments, it's important to be familiar with several key concepts and tools. Below are essential resources to guide you in configuring and managing these environments:

- [Okteto Manifest](core/okteto-manifest.mdx): The first step for platform engineers setting up Okteto is learning how to define the structure and configuration of your dev environment using the Okteto manifest. This file specifies everything from services and volumes to the commands that run in the environment.

- [Okteto Catalog](admin/catalog.mdx): The Catalog feature allows platform engineers to pre-configure a list of applications, from the Okteto web UI, that are made available to developers when they launch a dev environment from the UI. This catalog allows you to specify applications with pre-configured settings that your developers can easily launch a dev environment for with a single click.

- [External Resources](tutorials/external-resources.mdx): Okteto allows you to specify any cloud resource from any cloud provider (AWS S3 buckets, SQS Queues in GCP, etc.) that your application depends upon and make it a part of your developers's environments. This way developers manually don't have to configure things and you can ensure that security best practices are being followed when these resources are being created.
