Okteto Insights Dashboards provide real-time visibility into the performance and health of your applications and the infrastructure running in Okteto.
Analyzing this data can be helpful for understanding the performance of your Okteto cluster, including overall health, trends in build and deploy times, and the activity of users on the platform.

Okteto Insights Dashboards simplify the review of this data by offering out-of-the-box insights into essential metrics.
Whether youâ€™re looking to proactively identify bottlenecks, fine-tune resource allocation, or ensure that your applications are running smoothly, these dashboards provide the key data you need to make informed decisions.

Dashboards available:
- Node Metrics Dashboard
- Pod Metrics Dashboard
- Build and Deploy Metrics Dashboard
- Namespace, Preview, and User Metrics Dashboard

We've [open-sourced these Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/okteto/insights-dashboards) based on the Okteto Insights [data made available](#what-data-is-available).

### Node Metrics Dashboard
The Node Metrics dashboard is designed to give you a high level overview of cluster health. Focusing on CPU and Memory utilization, this can help you determine if your dev cluster has resources over-provisioned or under-provisioned.

Variables:
- Node Name: The name of the Kubernetes node to display specific data for.

  />

### Pod Metrics Dashboard
The Pod Metrics dashboard shows lower level information related to each Kubernetes Pod. This can help you to analyze the performance (memory leaks, CPU optimization, etc.) of the application code running in a particular namespace.

Variables
- Namespace: The name of the Okteto Namespace to display specific data for, filtered by the selected Development Environment
- Development Environment: The specific Okteto Development environment to display data for.

### Build and Deploy Metrics Dashboard
The Build and Deploy Metrics dashboard helps you understand how your application has been evolving over time by giving you data related to build and deploy times.

Variables
- Development Environment: Representing the name of the git repository to display specific metrics for. You can choose to see these metrics for the whole cluster or a particular application you have.

### Namespace, Preview, and User Metrics 
The Namespaces, Previews, and Users dashboard gives you metrics which help you measure how the platform is being adopted and used across your organization.
