Okteto Insights Dashboards offer visibility into the performance and health of your applications and the infrastructure running on Okteto.
These dashboards provide valuable insights into your Okteto cluster, including its overall health, trends in build and deploy times, and user activity on the platform.
Analyzing this data helps you better understand and optimize both the performance of your applications and the underlying infrastructure.

Whether you’re looking to proactively identify bottlenecks, fine-tune resource allocation, or ensure that your applications are running smoothly, these dashboards provide the key data you need to make informed decisions.

## Dashboards Available

Okteto integrates the following dashboards out of the box:

- [Cluster Nodes](#cluster-nodes-dashboard)
- [Nodes](#nodes-dashboard)
- [Pods](#pods-dashboard)
- [Build](#build-dashboard)
- [Deploy](#deploy-dashboard)
- [Activity Dashboard](#activity-dashboard)

### Cluster Nodes Dashboard

The Cluster Nodes dashboard provides a high-level overview of your cluster nodes' utilization, with a focus on CPU and memory usage.
It helps you determine whether your cluster is over- or under-provisioned.

The Cluster Nodes dashboard also assists in evaluating if the CPU and memory requests of your pods align with actual usage.
Pods under-utilizing their CPU/memory requests leads to wasted infrastructure, while Pods exceeding their CPU/memory requests can result in CPU throttling, pod evictions, or unbalanced workloads across the cluster.

### Nodes Dashboard

The Nodes dashboard offers a high-level overview of each cluster node's utilization, focusing on CPU and memory usage.
It helps troubleshoot performance issues on specific nodes and validate that your workloads are properly balanced across the cluster.

**Variables**

- Node Name: The name of the Kubernetes node to display specific data for.

### Pods Dashboard

The Pods dashboard shows usage information related to each Kubernetes Pod.
It helps you to analyze the performance (memory leaks, CPU optimization, etc.) of the application code running in a particular namespace.

## Consuming Insights metrics from other tools

View our [Okteto Insights Admin Documentation](admin/okteto-insights.mdx) to see all metrics behind the dashboards.

If you're interested in the calculations behind these dashboards, we've [open-sourced them](https://github.com/okteto/insights-dashboards) based on the Okteto Insights [data made available](admin/okteto-insights.mdx#what-data-is-available) through our scrape endpoint.
