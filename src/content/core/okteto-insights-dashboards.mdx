Okteto Insights Dashboards offer visibility into the performance and health of your applications and the infrastructure running on Okteto.
These dashboards provide valuable insights into your Okteto cluster, including its overall health, trends in build and deploy times, and user activity on the platform.
Analyzing this data helps you better understand and optimize both the performance of your applications and the underlying infrastructure.

Whether youâ€™re looking to proactively identify bottlenecks, fine-tune resource allocation, or ensure that your applications are running smoothly, these dashboards provide the key data you need to make informed decisions.

## Insights Dashboards

**Dashboards available:**
- [Node Metrics Dashboard](#node-metrics-dashboard)
- [Pod Metrics Dashboard](#pod-metrics-dashboard)
- [Build and Deploy Metrics Dashboard](#build-and-deploy-metrics-dashboard)
- [Namespace, Preview, and User Metrics Dashboard](#namespace-preview-and-user-metrics)

### Node Metrics Dashboard
The Node Metrics dashboard is designed to give you a high level overview of cluster health. Focusing on CPU and Memory utilization, this can help you determine if your dev cluster has resources over-provisioned or under-provisioned.

Variables:
- Node Name: The name of the Kubernetes node to display specific data for.

### Pod Metrics Dashboard
The Pod Metrics dashboard shows lower level information related to each Kubernetes Pod. This can help you to analyze the performance (memory leaks, CPU optimization, etc.) of the application code running in a particular namespace.

Variables
- Namespace: The name of the Okteto Namespace to display specific data for, filtered by the selected Development Environment
- Development Environment: The specific Okteto Development environment to display data for.

### Build and Deploy Metrics Dashboard
The Build and Deploy Metrics dashboard helps you understand how your application has been evolving over time by giving you data related to build and deploy times.

Variables
- Development Environment: Representing the name of the git repository to display specific metrics for. You can choose to see these metrics for the whole cluster or a particular application you have.

:::tip
View our [Okteto Insights Admin Documentation](admin/okteto-insights.mdx) to see all metrics behind the dashboards.

If you're interested in the calculations behind these dashboards, we've [open-sourced them](https://github.com/okteto/insights-dashboards) based on the Okteto Insights [data made available](admin/okteto-insights.mdx#what-data-is-available) through our prometheus endpoint.
If you are a SaaS or BYOC customer, you can ask your Okteto Solutions Architect to configure a Prometheus endpoint, allowing another tool to consume Insights data.
