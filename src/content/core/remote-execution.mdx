The Okteto Manifest allows you to define a list of `commands` to [deploy](core/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy), [test](core/okteto-manifest.mdx#test) and [destroy](core/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy) your application.
By default, your commands run locally in your machine, but we recommend that you enable remote execution.

## Enable remote execution

Enable remote execution by setting the `remote` field to `true` in the deploy/destroy section of your Okteto Manifest:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
deploy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

:::note
Remote execution is always enabled for `okteto test`
:::

By default, your commands will run in a remote container using our [default container image](https://github.com/okteto/pipeline-runner).
The default container image is a Debian Linux container with the following tools preinstalled:

- `bash`
- `cue`
- `curl`
- `envsubst`
- `git`
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `make`
- `okteto`
- `openssh`
- `wait-for-it`


Remote execution means you don't have to worry about installing tools like `helm`, `kubectl`, and others on your local machine.

### Defining your own Image

If you need custom tooling or advanced logic, you can use your own image for remote execution.
For example, if you want to use the image `runner:1.0` as the runtime of your remote execution, configure your Okteto Manifest like this:


```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
deploy:
  image: runner:1.0
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart
```

You can use your own image to force specific versions of your deployment tools and ensure that your team has a consistent experience when working with Okteto.

## How remote execution works

When running on remote, Okteto will automatically synchronize your local folder to a container running inside Buildkit:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/remote-execution.png").default}
    alt="Buildkit architecture"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

Okteto will connect your local SSH agent with the container running inside Buildkit.
For example, this lets you clone any private repository as part of your commands execution as long as your local agent has the proper ssh key configured.

## Ignoring files

Okteto looks for a file named `.oktetoignore` in your local folder. If this file exists, the CLI will exclude any files and directories in the command group that match patterns in it.
This helps to avoid unnecessarily synchronizing large or sensitive files and directories that are not used by the commands defined in the `deploy`, `destroy` or `test` section.

An example `.oktetoignore` file would be the following:

```
# applied to all commands
docs

# applied to deploy commands only
[deploy]
integration/*

# applied to destroy commands only
[destroy]
app

# applied to all test commands
[test]
app

# applied to unit test command only
[test.unit]
integration
```

This `.oktetoignore` expands to the following rules:

- For deploys, ignores `docs` and `integration/**`.
- For destroys, ignores `docs` and `app`. 
- For any test, ignores `docs` and `app`. 
- For the unit test specifically, ignores `docs`, `app` and `integration`.

Each command group in `.oktetoignore` uses the same format as [.dockerignore files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file).

:::note
For remote `deploy` and `destroy` operations, Okteto also reads the legacy `.oktetodeployignore` file but it will be deprecated in future versions.

## Enable remote execution by default

Remote Execution can also be made the default by configuring it in the Admin Panel.

Navigate to Admin -> General and scroll to the Settings section to enable it.

  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/remote-execution-setting.png").default}
    alt="Remote Execution Settings"
    width="850"
  />

:::warning
Local execution is deprecated. Okteto recommends that you enable remote execution for your deploy/destroy commands
