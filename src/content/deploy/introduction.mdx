Deploying your application to a development environment on Okteto is a simple process. It consists of installing the [Okteto CLI](deploy/using-the-cli.mdx), defining an [Okteto manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx), and executing the proper CLI command (or launching from the Okteto UI) to launch your development environment.

If you'd like a higher level view of how to launch your first application with Okteto, check out our [guide](get-started/deploy-first-app.mdx).

# Deploy components

The Okteto Platform is comprised of a few key components to enable the deploy functionality:

- A [Build service](components/build-service.mdx): enables you to build your container images remotely using Okteto's default build service (Buildkt)
- A [Container registry](components/container-registry.mdx): provides container storage for every namespace in your Okteto instance
- [Volume snapshots](components/use-volume-snapshots.mdx): lets you initialize persistent volume claims with the contents of a preexisting volume snapshot
- [Kubernetes credentials](components/kubernetes-credentials.mdx): a user's unique kubernetes credentials to optionally use Okteto with other CLI tools

# Okteto manifest

Also critical to the deployment of a development environment in Okteto is the manifest itself. Like a Docker compose file the Okteto manifest contains a set of instructions that Okteto uses to deploy your development environment. 

## Configuring the manifest

The Okteto manifest consists of the following sections: `build`, `deploy`, `dev`, `external`, and `destroy`. Each of these sections is responsible for specific behavior when deploying a development environment.

- Build: provides instructions on how to build the images that comprise your application's development environment
- Deploy: contains the instructions for deploying your development environment, usually consisting of `helm`, `kubectl`, and `okteto` commands
- Dev: provides a list of development containers to be created when using `okteto up` for synchronizing your code changes from your local machine
- External: contains a list of external resources that are part of your development environment that you'd like to include in the Okteto experience
- Destroy: provides the instructions for destroying all resources created by `okteto deploy` as well as any external resources you specified in the `external` section

For this example we'll use a basic Okteto manifest that includes the `build`, `deploy`, and `dev` sections:

```yaml
build:
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - api:/usr/src/app
  frontend:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - frontend:/usr/src/app
```
