title: Development Environments
description: In this section, we'll see how you can use Development Environments on Okteto
---

Development Environments enable developers to develop applications on Kubernetes with a joyful development experience.
Developers write code locally on their machine with the tools they love, and Okteto transparently updates their application on Kubernetes **as soon as they type codee**!

Developers don't have to spend time configuring and deploying their applications.
Everything is pre-configured in the Okteto manifest.
This way developers spend less time troubleshooting your development environment and more time coding cool features for their users ðŸ˜Ž

In this section you will learn about:

- [Install and configure](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) the Okteto CLI
- Follow [our samples](guides/samples/more.mdx) for different programming languages to hot reload and debug your app on Okteto using Development Containers
- Customize your [development images](deploy/development-environments.mdx) for a better developer experience
- Learn more about different ways to [deploy](deploy/deploy-index.mdx) your Development Environments
