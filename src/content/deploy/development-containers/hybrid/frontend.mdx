This tutorial will show you how to develop a sample Frontend application using Okteto Hybrid Mode.

## Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the Okteto CLI and configure it to access Okteto. [Follow our installation guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) if you haven't done so yet.

## Step 1: Deploy the Sample App

Get a local version of the Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
cd movies-with-helm
```

Checkout the branch with the Hybrid Mode configuration:

```console
git checkout hybrid
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yml` file.
This file describes how to deploy the Sample App.

```yaml
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart
    --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE}
    --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

The Sample App consists of the following services:

- A *React* based front-end, using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) as bundler and *hot-reload server* for development.
- A very simple Node.js API using [Express](https://expressjs.com).
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database.

Deploy the Sample App by executing:

```console
okteto deploy
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Running 'helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}'
...
 ✓  Development environment 'movies-with-helm' successfully deployed
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.dev
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.dev/api
```

## Step 2: Activate your Development Container

The [dev](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a Development Container for the Sample App:

```yaml
dev:
  frontend:
    mode: hybrid
    workdir: frontend
    command: bash
    reverse:
      - 80:80
```

The `frontend` key matches the name of the **frontend** Deployment. The definition of the rest of fields are:

- `mode`: to configure Hybrid development mode
- `workdir`: the working dir of the command
- `command`: the command to start the frontend service locally
- `reverse`: to expose the local port 80 in the Development Container port 80 using a reverse tunnel

Next, execute the following command to activate your Development Container:

```console
okteto up frontend
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Development environment 'microservices-demo' already deployed.
 ✓  Reverse tunnel configured
    Context:   okteto.example.com
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      frontend
    Reverse:   80 <- 80

bash-3.2$
```

You can run `yarn install` + `yarn start` to start the **frontend** service locally.
Your local process will be still available from its okteto endpoint because the local port `80` is accessible via a reverse tunnel to the cluster.
