title: File Sync Mode
description: In this section, we'll see how you can use File Sync mode to develop on Okteto

import Image from "@theme/Image";

File Sync is the default development mode. Using File Sync means your code changes are synchronized to the remote Development Container.

When you run `okteto up`, Okteto scales to zero the **api** Kubernetes Deployment and creates a mirror Deployment **api-okteto**.
**api-okteto** is a copy of the Kubernetes **api** Deployment manifest with the following development-time improvements:

- Okteto overrides the container-level configuration of the **api-okteto** Kubernetes Deployment with the values defined in your [Development Container](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional). A typical example of this is to replace the production container image with one that contains your development runtime
- A bidirectional file [synchronization service](reference/file-synchronization.mdx) is started to keep your changes up to date between your local filesystem and your Development Container
- Automatic port forwarding using [SSH](reference/ssh-server.mdx). This allows you to do things like access your cluster services via `localhost`

It's worth noting that your Development Container inherits the original **api** Kubernetes Deployment manifest.
Therefore, the Development Container uses the same service account, environment variables, secrets, volumes, sidecars, ... than the original **api** Kubernetes Deployment, providing a fully production-like development experience.

File sync works for applications of all shapes and forms. We have getting started guides for the following languages:

- [ASP.NET](guides/samples/aspnetcore.mdx)
- [Go](guides/samples/golang.mdx)
- [Java](guides/samples/java.mdx)
- [Node.js](guides/samples/node.mdx)
- [PHP](guides/samples/php.mdx)
- [Python](guides/samples/python.mdx)
- [Ruby](guides/samples/ruby.mdx)
