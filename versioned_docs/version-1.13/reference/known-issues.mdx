## Development environments do not hot-reload code changes

If you are using a hot reloader in your development environment, it might happen that your hot reloader does not pick the code changes even when they are properly synchronized to your development environment.

This is usually because the default *max watchers* value on your Kubernetes nodes is too low. To fix this issue, update the value of `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` in all your Kubernetes nodes (we recommend the value `10048576`).

For example, you can do it by running this command on each node:

```console
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=10048576
```

[Okteto](https://okteto.com) uses a Daemon Set to apply this change automatically to every Kubernetes node.

## The okteto prompt doesn't look right in Windows

Okteto's remote prompt uses [ANSI escape sequences](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-windows-console-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/) to display the namespace and development environment name in different colors. 

If you're using PowerShell and the terminal looks funky, this feature might not enabled. Run the command below to enable ANSI Color globally:

```console
Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Console VirtualTerminalLevel -Type DWORD 1
```
