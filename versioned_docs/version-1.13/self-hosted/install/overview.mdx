Okteto is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of the [Okteto Development Platform](index.md), with the control and flexibility of running in your own infrastructure.

Okteto is distributed as a Helm chart. This contains all the required components for the complete Okteto experience.

Okteto components:

1. NGINX Ingress
1. Okteto/API
1. Okteto/Buildkit
1. Okteto/Frontend
1. Okteto/Migration
1. Okteto/Registry
1. Okteto/Validation Webhook

## Installation

The Okteto chart contains all the required dependencies. This guide will walk you through the different options and features available.

1. [Preparation](self-hosted/install/preparation.mdx)
2. [Deployment](self-hosted/install/deployment.mdx)

If you are just looking to deploy a Proof of Concept, we recommend you follow our [Quick Installation Guides](#quick-installation-guides) for your first iteration.

### Upgrading

Instructions on how to upgrade your Okteto instance [are available here](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx).

Please review [the release notes before upgrading](self-hosted/install/releases.mdx). New features, known issues, and configuration changes will be listed there.

### Uninstalling Okteto

To delete an existing release use:

```console
$ helm delete <your-release-name>
```

This will delete Okteto, but not the resources created when using it (e.g. namespaces, accounts, deployments, etc...).
