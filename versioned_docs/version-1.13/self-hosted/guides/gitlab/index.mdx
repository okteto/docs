# Use Gitlab as your Identity Provider<TiersList tiers="Self-Hosted" />

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure Gitlab as the authentication provider for your Okteto instace.

Please refer to [GitLab's official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/openid_connect_provider.html) on Open ID Connect for more information.

## Prerequisites

- An instance of [Okteto](https://okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/).
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0+ installed in your local machine.
- Access to a [Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com) with permissions to enable and configure OAuth and OpenID. This can either gitlab.com, or self-hosted GitLab.

:::info
This guide will use https://gitlab.com in the examples. If you're using GitLab self-hosted, replace `gitlab.com` with the URL of your GitLab instance.

## Create the GitLab Application

Create a new OAuth application integration, using the values below:

- Name: "okteto"
- Redirect URI: "https://okteto.${YOUR_DOMAIN}.com/auth/callback"
- Unselect the `Confidential` checkbox
- Select the following scopes:
  - `openid`
  - `profile`
  - `email`

<p align="center">

    alt="Create the new GitLab App"
  />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/gitlab-new-app-scopes.png").default}
    alt="Set the OpenID Scopes for the GitLab App"
  />
</p>

Once the application has been created, copy the values of the `Application ID` and the `Secret`. You'll need them to configure your Okteto Instance.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/gitlab-app-created.png").default}
    alt="Copy the Application ID and Secret from the success page"
  />
</p>

Finally, browse to https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration, and copy the values of `issuer` and `authorization_endpoint`. You'll need this to finish configuration of your Okteto instance.

<p align="center">

    src={require("@site/static/img/gitlab-openid-configuration.png").default}
    alt="Copy the issuer and authorization_endpoint from the openid configuration response"
  />
</p>

## Configure Okteto

Once you have your GitLab configuration ready, you'll need to update the configuration of your Okteto Self-Hosted instance.

First, update the auth section of your Helm configuration file (e.g. `values.yaml` ) with the values you obtained on the first step of this guide:

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: "https://gitlab.com"
      authorization: "https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize"
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: email
```

> You can also store the value of clientSecret [as a secret directly in Kubernetes](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#store-sensitive-configuration-values-using-a-secret).

Then, [upgrade your installation](self-hosted/install/upgrade.mdx) to apply the changes. We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

Once the upgrade has been completed, go to your instance and click on the **Log In** button to access your instance. If everything is configured correctly, Okteto will now use Gitlab for user authentication.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/with-azure.png").default}
    alt="Log in with Gitlab"
  />
</p>

### Customize the attributes that Okteto consumes

By default, Okteto will use the following attributes below when creating a user:

- `Name` as the display name of the user.
- `Nickname` as the username of the user.
- `Email` as the email.
- `Picture URL` for the user's profile picture.

If you are not using some of those values, or you want to customize which attributes get mapped, you can customize that by using the `mapping` field inside the `openid` key in your Helm configuration file.

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: "https://gitlab.com"
      authorization: "https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize"
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
```

The value of every key in the `mapping` section must match a `claim` in your Gitlab OpenID configuration, and it must contain a non-empty value. You can see the available claims in the `claims_supported` section of https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration.
