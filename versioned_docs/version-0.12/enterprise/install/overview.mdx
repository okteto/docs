Okteto Enterprise is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of [Okteto Cloud](cloud.mdx), with the control and flexibility of running in your own infrastructure.

Okteto Enterprise is free for small teams.  You get all the features of [Okteto Enterprise](enterprise.mdx) for up to 3 users with 3 namespaces each.
