## Prerequisites

- An Instance of [Okteto Enterprise](/docs/0.12/enterprise/) running in [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS).
- Helm 3.0+ installed in your local machine
- AWS CLI installed in your local machine
- Access to an AWS account with access to S3, IAMs, and VPCs

## Create the Repository S3 Bucket

The charts are going to be stored in an S3 bucket. Create an S3 bucket via the UI or the `aws cli`, in the same region as your EKS cluster.

```
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket okteto-applications --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2
```

```
{
    "Location": "http://okteto-applications.s3.amazonaws.com/"
}
```

> This guide will use `okteto-applications` as the name of the bucket and `us-west-2` as the region for the sample commands. Replace accordingly.

Once the bucket is created, add the following policy, replacing `okteto-applications` with your bucket name.

```
cat << EOF > policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::okteto-applications/*",
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket okteto-applications --policy file://policy.json
```

This policy will make the objects in the bucket available to everyone, which is useful for public applications. We will show you how to lock this down in the final part of the guide.


## Package the Chart

Now that we have a functioning repository, we need to add a chart to it. For this guide, we'll use the `hello-okteto-chart` sample.

Get your local copy of the sample chart by running the command below:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/hello-okteto-chart
```

```
Cloning into 'hello-okteto-chart'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), 4.53 KiB | 4.53 MiB/s, done.
```

Once we have a chart, the next step is to package it. This will take all the files in the chart and bundle them in a single `tgz` file:

```
$ mkdir charts-repo
$ helm package ./hello-okteto-chart -d charts-repo
```

```
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: charts-repo/hello-okteto-0.1.0.tgz
```

Once the package is generated, we'll generate the repository index. Pass the public DNS of your `s3` bucket in the `url` parameter, as shown below:

```
helm repo index charts-repo --url https://okteto-applications.s3.amazonaws.com
```

Once this command completes, the `charts-repo` folder will contain two files: `index.yaml` and `hello-world-0.1.0.tgz`

> If you're adding the chart to an existing index, you should also use the `--merge` parameter. Run `helm repo index --help` to learn more.


## Publish the Chart

To publish the chart, we need to upload the files we generated in the previous step to the `s3` bucket. You can do it using the UI, or with the following command:

```
 aws s3 cp charts-repo s3://okteto-applications/ --recursive
```

You can verify that the chart was correctly published by adding the chart repo locally, and searching for the `hello-okteto` chart, as shown below:

```
$ helm repo add okteto https://okteto-applications.s3.amazonaws.com
$ helm search repo hello-okteto
```

```
NAME               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
okteto/hello-okteto	0.1.0        	1.0.0      	Hello world chart for Okteto
```

## Add the Repository to Okteto

Now that your application is in your private repository, you can add it to Okteto. Login into your instance, click on the `Settings` button in the left, and select the `Repositories` menu in the right.

Put the URL of your private repository, click on the `+` button, and press the `Save Changes` button.

Once added, all the applications in your repository will be available in the Application Catalog.

> Further instructions are available at /docs/tutorials/repos

To validate it, click on the `Namespaces` button on the left, and then on the `Deploy` button. Your application will be listed there, ready to be deployed with one click.

## Protect the Repository

If you followed the instruction in this guide, your repository will be available across the internet. If your applications are not meant to be publicly available, we recommend that you restrict it so that only your Okteto cluster can access it.

To do this, we are going to leverage AWS's [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) to only allow the nodes of our EKS cluster to access the S3 bucket without credentials.

First, we need to know the VPC of the EKS cluster. You can get it through the UI, or by running the command below, using your own cluster name:

```
$ aws eks describe-cluster --name cluster-1
```

```
{
    "cluster": {
        ...
        "resourcesVpcConfig": {
            ...
            "vpcId": "vpc-1"
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

Second, we need the ID of the routing table we are using. You can get it through the UI, or by running the command below, replacing the values of `vpc-id` with yours:

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-1
```

Now, we need to create a VPC endpoint. You can create it via the UI, or with the command below, replacing the values of `vpc-id` and `route-table-ids` with yours.
```
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-1 \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3 \
  --route-table-ids "rt-1'
```

> More information on this [is available here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html).

Finally, we'll update the S3 bucket with a policy that allows access from the VPC endpoint we just created.

```
cat << EOF > secure-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "VPCEPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-specific-VPCE-only",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::okteto-applications/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-0b4c1308c65c27339"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF

$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
okteto-applications --policy file://secure-policy.json
```

With this policy, the charts will only be available to authenticated users, or to resources sending traffic through that VPC Endpoint, like your `EKS` cluster.
