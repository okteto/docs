`okteto.yml` is a manifest format for describing development environments.

The Okteto Manifest has three main sections: `build`, `deploy` and `dev`, to define how to build, deploy and develop your development environment.

## Example

```yaml
build:
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - api:/usr/src/app
  frontend:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - frontend:/usr/src/app
```

## Schema reference

### build (object, optional)

A list of images to build as part of your development environment.

```yaml
build:
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    target: dev
```

Each image supports the following fields:

- `image`: the name of the image to build and push. In clusters that have Okteto installed, this is optional (if not specified, the [Okteto Registry](cloud/registry.mdx) is used).
- `context`: the build context. Relative paths are relative to the location of the Okteto Manifest (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It's a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the [multi-stage official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on.
- `export_cache`: image tag for exported cache when build.
- `cache_from`: list of images to import cache from.

In order to refer to these images from anywhere in your [Okteto Manifest](cloud/okteto-cli.mdx#okteto-manifest), you can use the following environment variables:

- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_TAG}`: SHA for the last image build at the registry
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_REGISTRY}`: the registry URL where the image was pushed
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_REPOSITORY}`: the name of the image that was pushed (`namespace/_<service>`)
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_IMAGE}`: the full image reference (using its SHA)

You can build all these images by running `okteto build`, or `okteto build xxx` to build a single one.

### context (string, optional)

The okteto context when the development environment is deployed. By default, it uses the current okteto context.

For example, to force that your development environment is always created on your _minikube_ context, you can define:

```yaml
context: minikube
```

You can use an environment variable to replace the context field, or any part of it:

```yaml
context: $DEV_CONTEXT
```

### dependencies ([string], optional)

A list of repositories you want to deploy as part of your development environment.

> `dependencies` is only supported in clusters that have Okteto installed.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
```

Use `okteto deploy --dependencies` to force the redeployment of your dependencies.

There is also an extended notation to configure how to deploy your dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
    manifest: okteto.yml
    branch: main
    variables:
      ENVIRONMENT: development
      DEBUG: true
    wait: true
```

Or:

```yaml
dependencies:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
    manifest: okteto.yml
    branch: main
    variables:
      - ENVIRONMENT: development
      - DEBUG: true
    wait: true
```

### deploy ([string], optional)

A list of commands to deploy your development environment.

It's usually a combination of `helm`, `kubectl`, and `okteto` commands.

```yaml
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

You can name your commands with the following syntax:

```yaml
deploy:
  - name: Deploy Movies App with Helm
    command: helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

There is also an extended notation to deploy Docker Compose files and [endpoints](reference/docker-compose.mdx#endpoints-object-optional) as part of your development environment:

```yaml
deploy:
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
  compose: docker-compose.yml
  endpoints:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 80
    - path: /api
      service: api
      port: 8080
```

or:

```yaml
deploy:
  compose:
    - docker-compose.yml
    - docker-compose.dev.yml
```

### destroy ([string], optional)

A list of commands to destroy external resources created by your development environment.

`okteto destroy` automatically takes care of destroying all the Kubernetes resources created by `okteto deploy`.

Use the `destroy` section if you create resources out of the scope of Kubernetes, like s3 buckets or RDS databases.

```yaml
destroy:
  - terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

### dev (object, optional)

A list of development containers to define the behavior of [okteto up](reference/cli.mdx#up) and synchronize your code in your development environment.

```yaml
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - api:/usr/src/app
  frontend:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - frontend:/usr/src/app
```

Each development container supports the following fields:

#### affinity (Affinity, optional)

Affinity allows you to constrain which nodes your development container is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: role
              operator: In
              values:
                - web-server
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

More information about affinity is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

#### autocreate (bool, optional)

If set to true, `okteto up` creates a deployment if `name` doesn't match any existing deployment in the current namespace (default: `false`).

#### command (string, optional)

Sets the command of your development container. If empty, it defaults to `sh`:

```yaml
command: bundle exec thin -p 3000
```

The command can also be a list:

```yaml
command: ["bundle", "exec", "thin", "-p", "3000"]
```

#### container (string, optional)

The name of the container in your deployment you want to put on development mode. By default, it takes the first one.

#### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables to your development container. If a variable already exists on your deployment, it will be overridden with the value specified on the manifest.

Environment variables with only a key, or with a value with a `$` sign resolve to their values on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

```yaml
environment:
  environment: development
  name: user-${USER:peter} ## will be replaced by the value of $USER or by "peter" if the the variable USER doe not exist
  DBPASSWORD: ## will be given the value of $DBPASSWORD if it exists
```

##### envFiles

Add environment variables to your development container from a file.

```yaml
envFiles:
  - .env1
  - .env2
```

Environment variables declared in the environment section override these values.

#### externalVolumes ([string], optional)

A list of persistent volume claims (not managed by okteto) that you want to mount in your development container.
This is useful to share cache information between different development containers.
For example, to share the go cache between different development containers, you could define:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - go-cache:/root/.cache/go-build/
```

on different okteto manifests. You can also mount a relative subpath of a given peristent volume claim:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - pvc-name:subpath:/var/lib/mysql
```

#### forward ([string], optional)

A list of ports to forward from your development container.
The list should follow the `localPort:remotePort` notation and each element should be unique.

You can also access other services running in your namespace by using the notation `localPort:remoteService:remotePort`.

```yaml
forward:
  - 8080:80
  - 5432:postgres:5432
```

You can also use the extended notation below to configure the service to be exposed using a label selector or its name.

```yaml
forward:
  - localPort: 8080
    remotePort: 80
    name: app
  - localPort: 5432
    remotePort: 5432
    labels:
      app: db
```

Once your development container is up and running, you will be able to access the port directly by using `localhost:localPort`.

> Common uses of port forwarding are:
>
> 1.  Access a service via `localhost` instead of via an ingress
> 1.  Remote debugging
> 1.  Connect to a hot reloader via a websocket

If Okteto can't forward a port (typically because they are already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.

#### initContainer (object, optional)

Allows you to override the okteto init container configuration of your development container.

```yaml
initContainer:
  image: okteto/bin:1.2.22
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
```

#### interface (string, optional)

Port forwards and reverse tunnels will be bound to this address. Defaults to `localhost`.

```yaml
interface: 0.0.0.0
```

#### image (string, optional)

Sets the docker image of your development container. Defaults to the image specified in your deployment.

> More information on development images [here](reference/development-environments.mdx)

You can use an environment variable to replace the image, or any part of it:

```yaml
image: okteto/dev:$USER
```

> More information on how to use private images for your development container [is available here](reference/faqs.mdx#how-to-use-private-images).

#### imagePullPolicy (string, optional)

The image pull policy of your development environment (default: `Always`)

#### lifecycle (boolean, optional)

If set to true, postStart and postStop lifecycle events are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
More information about lifecycle events is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which events to enable/disable:

```yaml
lifecycle:
  postStart: false
  postStop: true
```

- `postStart`: specifies if the postStart event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `postStop`: specifies if postStop event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

#### metadata (object, optional)

The metadata field allows to inject labels and annotations into your development container.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    fluxcd.io/ignore: "true"
  labels:
    custom.label/dev: "true"
```

#### nodeSelector (map[string]string, optional)

List of labels that the node must have to include the development container on it.

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
```

More information about nodeSelector is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

#### persistentVolume (object, optional)

Allows you to configure the okteto persistent volume:

- `enabled`: enable/disable the use of persistent volumes (default: `true`)
- `storageClass`: the storage class of the volume (default: the `default` storage class)
- `size`: the size of the okteto persistent volume (default: `2Gi`)

```yaml
persistentVolume:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: standard
  size: 30Gi
```

Note the following limitations:

- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [services](reference/manifest.mdx#services-object-optional).
- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [volumes](reference/manifest.mdx#volumes-string-optional).
- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you want to share command history across development containers while developing an app.

#### probes (boolean, optional)

If set to true, liveness, readiness, and start probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

More information about probes is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which probes to enable/disable:

```yaml
probes:
  liveness: true
  readiness: true
  startup: true
```

- `liveness`: specifies if liveness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `readiness`: specifies if readiness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `startup`: specifies if startup probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

#### resources (object, optional)

Allows you to override the resources configuration of your development container.
It follows the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container). By default, `requests` and `limits` are unset.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "64Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1Gi"
```

#### remote (integer, optional)

The local port to use for SSH communication with your development environment. Defaults to a random value.

```yaml
remote: 2222
```

> Setting this value in the manifest is equivalent to starting your development container with the `okteto up --remote=2222` command.

#### reverse ([string], optional)

A list of ports to reverse forward from your development container to your local machine.
The list should follow the `remotePort:localPort` notation and each element should be unique.

```yaml
reverse:
  - 9000:9001
  - 8080:8080
```

Once your development container is up and running, any requests to `0.0.0.0:remotePort` in the development container will be directed to `localhost:localPort`

> Common uses of reverse forwarding are:
>
> 1.  Remote debugging
> 1.  Send events or logs to your local machine

If Okteto can't reverse forward a port (typically because they're already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.

#### secrets ([string], optional)

A list of secrets that will be injected into your development container.
The format of a secret is `LOCAL_PATH:REMOTE_PATH:MODE`. `LOCAL_PATH` must exist, `REMOTE_PATH` must be an absolute path, and `MODE` is the remote file permissions in Base-8 (optional: defaults to `644`).

```yaml
secrets:
  - $HOME/.token:/root/.token:400
```

#### securityContext (object, optional)

Allows you to override the pod security context of your development container.

Okteto supports overriding the `fsGroup`, `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup` and `capabilities` values.
They're not set by default, and they follow the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 2000
  fsGroup: 3000
  capabilities:
    add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```

> Non-root Containers:
>
> If you're using a non-root container, and the runAsUser and runAsGroup values are not specified in your Kubernetes manifest, you need to set these values in your Okteto manifest. Remember to use the numeric ID in all cases, not the human readable name.

#### selector (map[string]string, optional)

The labels of the Kubernetes deployment/statefulset you want to put on development mode.
They must identify a single Kubernetes deployment/statefulset.

```yaml
selector:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: vote
```

#### sync ([string], required)

Specifies local folders that must be synchronized to the development container.

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
```

`sync` supports relative paths and environment variable expansion:

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
  - config:/etc/config
  - $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh
```

> Use the `.stignore` file on each local folder to avoid synchronizing build artifacts, dependencies, or git metadata. [More information is available here](reference/file-synchronization.mdx)

File sync can only update files that can be modified by your development container User ID.
If you are using okteto with persistent volumes, rememeber to set the field [securityContext.runAsUser](#securitycontext-object-optional) if your development container User ID is not `root`.

> You can [use secrets](reference/manifest.mdx#secrets-string-optional) if you need to synchronize a single file instead of a folder

There is also an extendend `sync` notation to fine tune the file synchronization service:

```yaml
sync:
  folders:
    - .:/code
  verbose: false
  compression: true
  rescanInterval: 100
```

- `folders`: list of local folders that must be synchronized to the development container
- `verbose`: enable verbose logging for syncthing (default: `true`)
- `compression`: compress files before synchronizing them (default: `false`)
- `rescanInterval`: the synchronization service [rescan internal](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/syncing.html?highlight=rescan#scanning) in seconds. It can be set to zero to disable rescans (default: `300`)

#### timeout (time, optional)

Maximum time to be waiting for creating a development container until an error is returned.

```yaml
timeout: 5m
```

You can also use the extended notation below to specify max time to be waiting for resources.

```yaml
timeout:
  default: 3m
  resources: 5m
```

#### tolerations ([object], optional)

A list of tolerations that will be injected into your development container.

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu
    operator: Exists
```

#### volumes ([string], optional)

A list of paths in your development container that you want to associate to persistent volumes.
This is useful to persist information between `okteto up` executions, like downloaded libraries or cache information.
For example, to speed your go builds up, you could define:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /go/pkg/
  - /root/.cache/go-build/
```

You can also mount a relative subpath of your local folder:

```yaml
volumes:
  - data:/var/lib/mysql
```

#### workdir (string, optional)

Sets the working directory of your development container.

### icon (string, optional)

The icon associated to your development environmen in the Okteto Dashboard (optional).

### name (string, optional)

The name of your development environment. It defaults to the name of your git repository.

### namespace (string, optional)

The namespace where the development environment is deployed. By default, it takes the current okteto context namespace.

You can use an environment variable to replace the namespace field, or any part of it:

```yaml
namespace: $DEV_NAMESPACE
```

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of the Okteto Manifest that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Substitute environment variables

It’s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside an okteto manifest:

```yaml
image: "node:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in the okteto manifest in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the okteto manifest.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat okteto.yml
...
    image: "node:${TAG}"
...
```

When you any Okteto CLI command, `image` will be `node:v1.5`.

> Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.
