This section will show you how to automatically create a preview environment for your applications using Okteto Cloud and GitHub Actions.

## Pre-Requisites
- An [Okteto Cloud account](https://cloud.okteto.com)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)

For this tutorial, we'll be using [this application](https://github.com/okteto/movies).

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the [movies](https://github.com/okteto/movies) repository with your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Create the GitHub Workflow

To create the preview environments, we will use our [GitHub Actions for Okteto Cloud](https://github.com/okteto/actions).

Creating a preview environment requires performing the following steps:

1. Log into Okteto Cloud.
1. Deploy a preview environment in Okteto Cloud.
1. Update the PR with the URL of the preview environment.

The sample repository configured to use [the workflow described above](https://github.com/okteto/movies/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview.yaml).
If you want to use this on for your repositories, all you need to do is to create a `.github/workflow` folder in the root of your repo, and save your workflow file in it.

The workflow file to create the preview environments for Okteto Cloud users looks like this:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: Deploy preview environment
      uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
      env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
        timeout: 15m
```

### Preview Environments for Okteto Enterprise Users

To configure preview environments for [Okteto Enterprise](https://okteto.com/enterprise/), you need to specify the url of your Okteto Enterprise instance as
a parameter in the `context` action:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}
        url: https://okteto.example.com

    - name: Deploy preview environment
      uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
      env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
        scope: global
        timeout: 15m

```

In Okteto Enterprise, you have access to two different scopes for preview environments:
-  `personal`, where the only one who has access to the environment is the logged user.
-  `global`, where all cluster members have access to it and do not need to have the user's name at the end of the preview environment name. Only  administrators cancreate a preview environment with global scope.

## Step 3: Configure your Okteto API Token

If you noticed, the workflow uses the `secrets:OKTETO_TOKEN`. We do this, so we don't have to commit the token into our repo. Before you run this workflow you need to create the `OKTETO_TOKEN` secret in your repository, with your personal access token as the value.

[Follow the process in this guide to create a personal access token](/docs/cloud/personal-access-tokens/).

Once you've created the personal access token, add it to your GitHub repository following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). 

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are in your repository, go ahead and open a new pull request. GitHub will receive the event, and it will start your workflow. You can see the workflow's status and logs in the `checks` section of the pull request.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/check.png"alt="checks section of pull request" width="650" /></p>

## Step 5: See your changes live

After a few seconds, the workflow will update the pull request with the URL of your preview environment. Click on it to see the changes in real-time.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/preview-environments/images/message.png" alt="preview environment message with URL" width="650" /></p>

Every time the branch is updated, the same workflow will run, automatically updating the preview environment.

## Step 6: Cleanup

The sample repo also includes a workflow [to cleanup the preview environments](https://github.com/okteto/movies/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml) once the pull request is closed. We recommend you follow this pattern to remove the preview environment after merging a pull request automatically.

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: Destroy preview environment
      uses: okteto/destroy-preview@latest
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
```

For Okteto Enterprise users:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        url: ${{secrets.OKTETO_URL}}
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: Destroy preview environment
      uses: okteto/destroy-preview@latest
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
```
