# Setting up Certificates with cert-manager and Let’s Encrypt

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority. Certificates can be automatically requested using various tools. A very popular way of requesting certificate from Let's Encrypt is [by using cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).

When using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), you need to use a [DNS01](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#delegated-domains-for-dns01) auth method in your [Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/), since Okteto requires a wildcart certificate.
Check the list of supported providers [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/) for more information.

Our community maintains guides on how to use cert-manager together with different Cloud Providers to generate certificates for Okteto:
