## Configuration file

Before running `helm install`, we recommend that you create a yaml configuration file with your choices about how to install Okteto. This guide will walk you through the most common options. A complete list of configuration options is [available here](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx).

You can use [this sample configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/install/config.yaml) as a starting point. The different configuration settings are explained below.

### Cluster Endpoint

This is the public endpoint of your Kubernetes cluster. It will be used by Okteto when generating `Kubeconfig` credentials for your users.

```yaml
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://52.30.32.1"
```

Run the following command to obtain your cluster's API server endpoint:

```
kubectl config view --minify | grep server
```

### Domain

You'll need sufficient access to a [subdomain](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#subdomain) to add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.
By default, all endpoints created by Okteto for your development environments will be exposed on the wildcard subdomain you choose.

```yaml
subdomain: "dev.example.com"
```

### License

Okteto is free for small teams.  You get all the features of [Okteto](self-hosted.mdx) for up to 3 users.

```yaml
license: XXXXX
```

## Deploy the Okteto Chart

Run `helm install` to deploy your Okteto instance. In this example, we have named our Helm release okteto.

```console
$ helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
$ helm repo update
$ helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --create-namespace
```

> You can also use `--version version` if you would like to install a specific version of Okteto.

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the NGINX controller service External-IP:
- "*.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto

2. Once you create both DNS entries you can access your Okteto instance at this URL:
https://okteto.dev.example.com
```

Once the chart is installed, follow the onscreen instructions to finalize the configuration.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

After a successful installation, you can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully login into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.

> **Important**: The default installation is not recommended for production use. We highly advise following the steps outlined in the [Admin Dashboard](administration/dashboard.mdx) before giving your team access to your Okteto instance.

The default installation is all that's required to follow our [getting started](getting-started.mdx) guide.
Just remember to replace https://cloud.okteto.com by `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN` and you will be good to go!
