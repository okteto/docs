> Public access to the GraphQL API is in beta, and it is subject to breaking changes without notice.

## The GraphQL API endpoint

If you using Okteto Cloud, the endpoint is available at:

```
https://cloud.okteto.com/graphql
```

For Okteto users, the endpoint will be available at:

```
https://$YOUR_OKTETO_INSTANCE/graphql
```

The endpoint remains constant no matter what operation you perform.

## Authentication

To communicate with the GraphQL API, you'll need your Okteto API token. You can get to it by browsing to your Okteto instance and clicking on the `Settings` button on the left of the Okteto UI.

<p align="center">
  <Image

    width="650"

  />
</p>

When making a GraphQL request, you always need to include your token as a bearer token authentication header.

## Making GraphQL Calls

Because GraphQL operations consist of multiline JSON, we recommend using a GraphQL client when making the calls, such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). You can also use cURL or any other HTTP-speaking library.

When using a REST api, http verbs determine the operation to perform. In GraphQL, you'll send a JSON body independently of the operation you're performing, so the http verb is always POST. The only exception is an introspection query, which is a GET to the endpoint, used to get information on the GraphQL endpoint.

```
curl -XPOST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"       \
  -H  "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"        \
  -d '{"query": "query { user { email }}"}' \
  https://cloud.okteto.com/graphql
```

The full schema of our GraphQL API <a href="https://okteto.com/docs/api/schema/">is available here</a>.

## Example Scenarios

### Create Namespace

Request body:

```
mutation{
  createSpace(name: "api-cindy", members:""){
    id
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- name: The name of the namespace.
- members: List of emails of the members of the space. Using this to share it with your team (optional).

The `createSpace` mutation is idempotent. If you execute it on a namespace that already exists, it will update the member list.

### Delete Namespace

Request body:

```
mutation{
  deleteSpace(id: "api-cindy"){
    id
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- name: The name of the namespace.

Danger! Use this API with extreme care, as _it will delete everything in the namespace_, including your volumes. Don't say we didn't warn you.

### Deploy Helm Application

Request body:

```
mutation {
  deployApp(
    version: "0.1.0",
    config: "bW9uZ29kYjoKICBtb25nb2RiUGFzc3dvcmQ6ICJQYXNzd29yZCExQDIiIA=="
    name: "my-instance",
    space: "cindy"
    repo: "https://apps.okteto.com",
    chart: "movies"
  ){
    name
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- chart: The name of the application
- repo: The URL of the application repository
- name: The name of your application instance, must be unique
- space: The name of the namespace to deploy into
- version: The version to deploy
- config: The base64 encoded configuration of your application

The `deployApp` mutation is idempotent. If you execute it on an application that already exists, it will upgrade the application.

### Destroy Helm Application

Request body:

```
mutation {
  deployApp(
    space: "cindy"
    name: "my-instance",
    ) {
    name
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- space: The namespace to use
- name: The name of your application instance, must be unique
