In this step you will learn how to expose your application using Okteto Endpoints.

In order to create endpoints for your application, you need to add the following annotation to your [Ingress](https://github.com/okteto/getting-started/blob/main/chart/templates/ingress.yaml) resource:

```yaml title="ingress.yaml"
annotations:
  dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
```

The Ingress object, located in the file `chart/templates/ingress.yaml`, will look like this after this change:

```yaml title="ingress.yaml"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: movies
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "true"
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: api
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

This instructs Okteto to create an endpoint in the [Okteto Subdomain](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#subdomain).
For example, if your Ingress name is `movies` in the `cindy` namespace, your app will be accessible at https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com if your Okteto domain is okteto.example.com.

Deploy the Movies app to apply the changes:

```bash
okteto deploy
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com/api
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

Notice how the endpoints are now shown by the Okteto CLI. You can also see the endpoints within the Okteto UI. Endpoints will only be present when a service reaches the "running" stage.

Finally, you can access the endpoint of the Movies app to see something like this:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/next-ui-movies.png").default}
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

## Next Steps

The Movies app is using pre-built images to deploy your Development Environment...

This is not ideal since you won't be able to deploy your local changes, let's [build the images of the Movies app](build.mdx) in next step of this guide ðŸ˜Ž
