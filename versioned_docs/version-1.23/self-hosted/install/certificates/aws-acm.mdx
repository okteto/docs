# Setting up certificates with AWS ACM

This guide will walk you through the process of setting certificates issued by or imported into Amazon Certificate Manager.

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following CLI installed in your machine:

- `aws` >= 2.15 ([aws installation guides](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions))

You'll also need to install the Load Balancer Controller in your Kubernetes cluster.
If you haven't done it yet, follow our guide to [create the Load Balancer Controller IAM Role](get-started/install/amazon-eks.mdx#create-load-balancer-controller-iam-role) and [deploy the Load Balancer Controller](get-started/install/amazon-eks.mdx#deploy-load-balancer-controller) to your Kubernetes cluster.

:::note
If you don't install the Load Balancer Controller, you will need to setup the ALPN policy to HTTP2Preferred in the AWS NLB TLS listener at port 443.
:::

## Setting up environment variables

We recommend configuring the following environment variables to help you scripting the certificate configuration:

The [Okteto Domain](get-started/install/amazon-eks.mdx#a-domain-and-the-ability-to-create-wildcard-dns-records-for-it) used in your Okteto installation:

```bash
export OKTETO_DOMAIN="<<your-okteto-domain>>"
```

Your AWS Region:

```bash
export AWS_REGION="$(aws configure get region)"
```

Disable AWS CLI pagination (optional):

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

## Create an AWS Route 53 DNS Zone

Okteto uses a DNS zone for both its internal endpoints (e.g., registry, kubernetes, buildkit) and also your application endpoints.
Create a DNS zone with the following command:

```bash
aws route53 create-hosted-zone \
    --name="${OKTETO_DOMAIN}" \
    --caller-reference="$(date +%s)"
```

From the output, take note of the following properties:

- `HostedZone.Id`, set it as the value of the following environment variable:
  
```bash
export HOSTED_ZONE_ID="<<your-hosted-zone-id>>"
```

- `DelegationSet.Nameservers[]`, use them to delegate the DNS zone from your domain nameservers.

:::tip
You can recover the nameservers of your DNS zone with the following command:
```bash
aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id="${HOSTED_ZONE_ID}"
```
:::

## Request a Certificate Using AWS ACM with DNS Validation

Okteto requires a wildcard certificate that matches its DNS zone.
Request a certificate with the following command:


```bash
aws acm request-certificate \
    --domain-name="*.${OKTETO_DOMAIN}" \
    --validation-method="DNS" \
    --region="${AWS_REGION}"
```

From the output, take note of the following property:

- `CertificateArn`, it identifies the certificate for usage in AWS integrated services.
  
```bash
export CERTIFICATE_ARN="<<your-certificate-arn>>"
```

## Publish the Validation Records to the DNS Zone

:::warning
Before continuing, ensure that the DNS zone you created is authoritative and correctly delegated from your main domain
:::

First, get the validation records with the following command:

```bash
aws acm describe-certificate \
  --certificate-arn="${CERTIFICATE_ARN}" \
  --region="${AWS_REGION}" \
  --query='Certificate.DomainValidationOptions[0].ResourceRecord'
```

Create a change batch file and replace the values highlighted:

```json title="resource-record.json"
{
  "Comment": "Add a CNAME record for foo to point to bar.com",
  "Changes": [
    {
      "Action": "CREATE",
      "ResourceRecordSet": {
        // highlight-next-line
        "Name": "REPLACE ME WITH RESOURCE RECORD NAME",
        "Type": "CNAME",
        "TTL": 300,
        "ResourceRecords": [
          {
            // highlight-next-line
            "Value": "REPLACE ME WITH RESOURCE RECORD VALUE"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Publish the validation records:

```bash
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id="${HOSTED_ZONE_ID}" \
  --change-batch=file://resource-record.json
```

Watch the status of the validation:

```bash
aws acm describe-certificate \
  --certificate-arn="${CERTIFICATE_ARN}" \
  --region="${AWS_REGION}" \
  --query='Certificate.DomainValidationOptions[0].ValidationStatus'
```

It will eventually change from `PENDING_VALIDATION` to `SUCCESS`.

:::tip
You can wait until your certificate is validated with the following command:

```bash
aws acm wait certificate-validated \
  --certificate-arn="${CERTIFICATE_ARN}" \
  --region="${AWS_REGION}"
```

It internally polls the AWS API every 60 seconds. It will exit with a 255 exit code after 40 failed attempts.
:::

## Configure Okteto to use your ACM Certificate

Apply the following snippet to your Okteto Helm configuration file and replace the highlighted value:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    service:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "ssl"
        // highlight-next-line
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: "<<your-certificate-arn>>"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "https"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing" 
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-alpn-policy: "HTTP2Preferred"
```

Finally, [upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

:::note
If you didn't install the Load Balancer Controller, you will need to setup the ALPN policy to HTTP2Preferred in the AWS NLB TLS listener at port 443.
[Use the official AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/listener-update-certificates.html#update-alpn-policy) for instructions on how to do this using the console or through the AWS CLI.
