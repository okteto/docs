This section will show you how to automatically create a preview environment for your applications using Okteto and GitHub Actions.

## Pre-Requisites

- An Okteto account
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)

For this tutorial, we'll be using [this application](https://github.com/okteto/movies).

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the [movies](https://github.com/okteto/movies) repository with your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Create the GitHub Workflow

To create the preview environments, we will use our [GitHub Actions for Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/actions).

Creating a preview environment requires performing the following steps:

1. Log into Okteto Cloud.
1. Deploy a preview environment in Okteto.
1. Update the PR with the URL of the preview environment.

The sample repository configured to use [the workflow described above](https://github.com/okteto/movies/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview.yaml).
If you want to use this on for your repositories, all you need to do is to create a `.github/workflow` folder in the root of your repo, and save your workflow file in it.

The workflow file to create the preview environments looks like this:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Context
        uses: okteto/context@latest
        with:
          url: ${{secrets.OKTETO_URL}}
          token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy preview environment
        uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
          timeout: 15m
```

There are two different scopes for preview environments:

- `personal`, where the only one who has access to the environment is the logged user.
- `global`, where all cluster members have access to it and do not need to have the user's name at the end of the preview environment name. Only administrators cancreate a preview environment with global scope.

> The `global` scope is not supported in Okteto Cloud

## Step 3: Configure your secrets

If you noticed, the workflow uses the `secrets:OKTETO_TOKEN` and `secrets:OKTETO_URL`. We do this, so we don't have to commit these values into our repo.

Before you run this workflow you need to create the following secrets in your repository:

- `OKTETO_TOKEN` with your personal access token as the value.
- `OKTETO_URL` with the URL of your Okteto instance (if left empty, it will default to https://cloud.okteto.com)

[Follow the process in this guide to create a personal access token](https://okteto.com/docs/cloud/personal-access-tokens/). Once you've created the personal access token, add it to your GitHub repository following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are in your repository, go ahead and open a new pull request. GitHub will receive the event, and it will start your workflow. You can see the workflow's status and logs in the `checks` section of the pull request.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/preview-check.png").default}
    alt="checks section of pull request"
    width="650"
  />
</p>

## Step 5: See your changes live

After a few seconds, the workflow will update the pull request with the URL of your preview environment. Click on it to see the changes in real-time.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/preview-message.png").default}
    alt="preview environment message with URL"
    width="650"
  />
</p>

Every time the branch is updated, the same workflow will run, automatically updating the preview environment.

## Step 6: Cleanup

The sample repo also includes a workflow [to cleanup the preview environments](https://github.com/okteto/movies/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml) once the pull request is closed. We recommend you follow this pattern to remove the preview environment after merging a pull request automatically.

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Context
        uses: okteto/context@latest
        with:
          url: ${{secrets.OKTETO_URL}}
          token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Destroy preview environment
        uses: okteto/destroy-preview@latest
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
```
