This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We'll be focusing exclusively on EKS in order to keep it as simple as possible.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you'll need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)
- A GitHub OAuth application
- An IAM user
- An S3 bucket
- An Okteto License (optional)

### Subdomain

You'll need access to a subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.

This guide will assume that your domain is registered in [Amazon Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). Other DNS services can be used, but aren't covered here.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow Amazon's [cluster creation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html).
Okteto supports Kubernetes versions 1.21 through 1.23.

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.23
- A pool with at least 3 `m4.xlarge` nodes
- 250 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.
Run the following command to obtain your cluster's API server endpoint:

```
kubectl config view --minify | grep server
```

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.

### Installing kubectl

Follow Amazon's documentation for [installing kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to [talk to your new cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

### Installing Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Creating the GitHub OAuth application

> Okteto supports OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, or OpenID Connect to handle user authentication. For this guide, we'll focus on using GitHub. All the supported configuration settings [are described here](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#auth).

> If you are planning on using the GitHub Integration, you should follow [this guide](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#creating-the-github-app). You'll then use the same Github Application for the Integration as the one from Oauth.

Follow GitHub's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

When creating the OAuth App, you will need to provide the following values:

**Homepage URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorization callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

You'll use the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` when installing Okteto.

### Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket

Okteto uses S3 to store your private images. Follow Amazon's [guide on how to create s3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html). Create the bucket in the region as your EKS cluster, and keep it private.

### Creating an IAM

The Okteto Registry needs access to a S3 bucket to store your container images.

We recommend you follow AWS' official documentation on [how to create and manage IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) for more information on this.

You'll need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create an `IAM User`
1. Create a set of Access keys for your `IAM User` and save them locally. We'll be using this when installing Okteto.
1. Create an `IAM Policy` with the following permissions (replace `YOUR_BUCKET` with your `s3` bucket name)
      ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket",
                      "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                      "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:PutObject",
                      "s3:GetObject",
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                      "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/*"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```
1. Attach the previous `IAM Policy` to the previous `IAM User`

## Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

Okteto is free for up to 3 users without a license.
You can also sign on for the [free trial](https://www.okteto.com/free-trial/) to give access up to 100 users for a month.

## Installing Okteto

### Create the Okteto Namespace

Run the following command to create a namespace to install Okteto in:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace okteto
```

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Create a Kubernetes secret with the IAM User's Access secret key you created before:

```console
kubectl create secret generic okteto-cloud-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=key=IAM_ACCESS_SECRET
```

Download a copy of the [Okteto EKS configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/eks/config.yaml), open it, and update the following values:

- Your `email`
- Your `license` (optional)
- A `subdomain`
- `clientId` and `clientSecret` of the OAuth Application you created
- You GitHub `organization`.  An empty `organization` field permits any user to log in.
- Your cluster's API server endpoint
- The name of the `bucket` you created
- The `Access key ID` of the IAM User

> You can also configure Okteto to assume a role instead of using access keys. Check the [AWS section in the configuration page](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#cloud) to learn more.

For example:

```yaml
email: admin@example.com
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://XXXXXX.gr7.us-west-2.eks.amazonaws.com"

auth:
  github:
    enabled: true
    clientId: ae8924d074d8c8809999
    clientSecret: ABCD90598b706d5342f07cce18fee5e5da391234
    organization: my-org

cloud:
  provider:
    aws:
      enabled: true
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: okteto-private-images
      iam:
        accessKeyID: "XXXXXX"

buildkit:
  ingress:
    enabled: false
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto
```

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the NGINX controller service External-IP:
- "*.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto

2. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the Buildkit service External-IP:
- "buildkit.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto

3. Once you create both DNS entries you can access your Okteto instance at this URL:
https://okteto.dev.example.com
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

We can use the instructions `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by EKS to the NGINX Ingress we've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP                          PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller  LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    a519c8b3b27f94...elb.amazonaws.com   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. In Route 53, this is done by creating an `A` record with the name  `*`, pointing to the alias of the Elastic Load Balancer.

> Note: avoid using a `CNAME` record for `*` pointing to the public hostname of the Elastic Load Balancer, as it will block the cert-manager default capability for issuing/renewing certificates via ACME dns01.

### Retrieve the Buildkit IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by EKS to the Buildkit instance you've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                           PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   a519c8b3b27f95...elb.amazonaws.com    1234:32449/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. This is done by creating an `A` record with the name `buildkit`.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

> **Important**: The default installation uses self-signed certificates. We strongly recommend that you  configure Okteto to [bring your own certificates](self-hosted/administration/certificates.mdx) before giving your team access to your instance.

You can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully log into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.
