##  Upgrade your Okteto Instance

To upgrade a new release, modify the `config.yaml` with your desired changes and then use:

```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade <your-release-name> okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version <version_number>
```

For example:
```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version 1.7.0
```
*You can use `helm ls` to find the name of your release.*

Please review [the release notes](self-hosted/install/releases.mdx) before upgrading. New features, known issues, and configuration changes will be listed there.

## Upgrading to Okteto 1.7.x

As part of [1.7.0](self-hosted/install/releases.mdx#170), we have changed the default behavior of BuildKit to don't use a persistent volume. You have to include the following setting in your configuration file to keep using persistency:

```yaml
buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
```

We have also moved the configuration settings needed to configure the external storage for the registry. Before, it was configured under `cloud` key and now it has to be configured under `registry` key.

So, before `1.7.X`, the configuration to configure external storage would look like this:

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    aws:
      enabled: true
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: okteto-private-images
      iam:
        accessKeyID: "XXXXXX"
```

That configuration will still work for backward compatibility, but we recommmend you to update it to the new keys. In order to do so, you need to change to this:

```yaml
registry:
  secret:
    name: "okteto-cloud-secret"
    secretKey: "key"
  storage:
    provider:
      aws:
        enabled: true
        region: us-west-2
        bucket: okteto-private-images
        iam:
          accessKeyID: "XXXXXX"
```

> If you didn't override a value for `cloud.secret`, you need to include the `registry.secret` section as posted in the previous snippet to keep working with the previous default values specified by the Okteto chart.
>
> If you had a custom value for `cloud.secret`, you need to specify the right values under `registry.secret` key.

## Upgrading from Okteto 0.x to 1.x

Okteto 1.x has two major breaking changes that you need to be aware of before upgrading:

- Support for Kubernetes 1.19 has been removed, and 1.20 is deprecated.
- The helm chart has been renamed from `okteto-enterprise` to `okteto`. All the resources created by the chart will have `okteto` as their prefix instead of `okteto-enterprise`. This change will cause all resources to be recreated upon upgrade.  Depending on your cloud provider and your networking configuration, you might need to update the DNS entry of the [build service](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#buildkit) after upgrading your Okteto instance.
- The helm chart doesn't install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) by default.

We recommend that you follow the steps below to reduce the disruption of the service to a minimum:

### Before upgrade

Skip this step if you are [bringing your own certificates](self-hosted/administration/certificates.mdx).
Check if this is the case by seeing that the wildcard creation is disabled in the Okteto helm values configuration:

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
```

If Okteto was generating the certificates for you, run the following command from your command line to make sure `helm upgrade` doesn't remove the existing cert-manager issuer and certificates:

```
kubectl -n okteto annotate issuer okteto-okteto-enterprise helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
kubectl -n okteto annotate certificate default-ssl-certificate helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto helm values file to use the existing certificate:

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: default-ssl-certificate

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/default-ssl-certificate
```

> Keeping the same `issuer` and `certificate` reduces moving parts during the upgrade, but we recommend you to [bring your own certificate](self-hosted/administration/certificates.mdx) once the Okteto upgrade has been complete succesfully.

### Upgrade Okteto

Run the following commands to upgrade your Okteto instance:

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm upgrade --install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto
```

#### After upgrade

Use `kubectl` to get the new address of the build service:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                           PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   a519c8b3b27f95...elb.amazonaws.com    1234:32449/TCP   5m
```

Update your DNS configuration with the `EXTERNAL-IP` address.

If you are [bringing your own certificates](self-hosted/administration/certificates.mdx), your Okteto instance is now fully upgraded. The rest of the guide doesn't apply to your configuration.

### Install cert-manager

Okteto will remove the instance of `cert-manager` that was installed by older versions of the helm chart. If you plan on using `cert-manager` as your certificate provider, you'll need to install it manually in your cluster using the instructions below:

```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace=okteto --version=v1.10.2 --set global.podSecurityPolicy.enabled=true
```

Once installed, cert-manager will continue to renew your existing certificates.
Please refer to [their docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) if you run into any installation or certificate renewal issues.

## Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25

Kubernetes version 1.25 no longer supports pod security policies.
If you are running Okteto in Kubernetes < 1.25, the default installation of Okteto creates pod security policies.
If you upgrade Kubernetes to version 1.25 before upgrading Okteto, you will encounter the following error during the upgrade process:

```
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: unable to build kubernetes objects from current release manifest: [resource mapping not found for name: "okteto-permissive" namespace: "" from "": no matches for kind "PodSecurityPolicy" in version "policy/v1beta1"
ensure CRDs are installed first, resource mapping not found for name: "okteto-restrictive" namespace: "" from "": no matches for kind "PodSecurityPolicy" in version "policy/v1beta1"
ensure CRDs are installed first]
```

> You can find more information about how to recover from this state in this [community link](https://community.okteto.com/t/upgrade-failed-with-no-matches-for-kind-podsecuritypolicy-in-version-policy-v1beta1/802).

To avoid this issue, upgrade Okteto before upgrading Kubernetes to version 1.25 and add the following configuration to your helm values file:

```
podSecurityPolicy:
   enabled: false
```
