This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Civo's Kubernetes Service.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you'll need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)
- An Okteto License

### Subdomain

You'll need sufficient access to a [subdomain](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#subdomain) to add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.
By default, all endpoints created by Okteto for your development environments will be exposed on the wildcard subdomain you choose.

This guide assumes your domain is registered in [Civo DNS](https://www.civo.com/account/dns).
You can use any DNS service you prefer, but this guide focuses specifically on Civo DNS.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

If you are not familiar with this step, we recommend that you follow Civos's [cluster creation guide](https://www.civo.com/learn/kubernetes-cluster-administration-using-civo-cli).

To get started with Okteto, we recommend that you create a Kubernetes cluster with the following configuration:

- 3 large nodes
- Default network
- Without Traefik (you'll need to remove it from the default apps)

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.

### Installing kubectl

Follow the official documentation for [installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to [talk to your new cluster](https://www.civo.com/learn/kubernetes-cluster-administration-using-civo-cli#downloading-the-cluster-39-s-configuration).

### Installing Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository in order to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

You'll receive a license key as part of your subscription to Okteto. If you haven't received it, [please open a support ticket](https://okteto.com/support).

## Installing Okteto

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Download a copy of the [Okteto Civo configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/civo/config.yaml), open it, and update the following values:

- Your `license`
- A `subdomain`
- Your cluster's API server endpoint

For example:

```yaml
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://35.205.100.149"
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --create-namespace
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
```

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by Civo to the NGINX Ingress you've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller  LoadBalancer   10.245.147.23  91.211.154.196  80:30087/TCP,443:31799/TCP,1234:31412/TC    2m
```

You'll need to create a wildcard DNS record for this IP. To do that, log in to your Civo account, click on the "Manage" option on the left part of the dashboard, and click on "DNS".

Select the domain you're using for your Okteto instance, and click on the "DNS Records" option.

Click on the "Add a Record" button and use the following values:

- Type: A
- Name: \*
- Value: Your EXTERNAL-IP

  />
</p>

Click on the "Add Record" button to create the DNS record.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

After a successful installation, you can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully login into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.

> **Important**: The default installation is not recommended for production use. We highly advise following the steps outlined in the [Admin Dashboard](administration/dashboard.mdx) before giving your team access to your Okteto instance.

The default installation is all that's required to follow our [getting started](getting-started.mdx) guide.
