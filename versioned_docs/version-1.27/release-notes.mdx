## 1.27.0

12 December 2024

This version is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.27 to 1.30 \
Okteto Chart release 1.27 is designed to work with [Okteto CLI 3.2.x](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1)

### Breaking Changes

- Remove code for our deprecated Quickstarts feature <!-- 8842 -->
- Helm chart now separates registry and repository fields for overwriting container images.
Update configurations for `backend.image`, `frontend.image`, `buildkit.image`, `buildkit.rootless.image`, `registry.image` following [this guide](self-hosted/manage/air-gapped.mdx#step-2-set-up-a-private-registry-for-required-images) if you have previously overwritten these.
- `cue`, `helmfile`, `kustomize`, `yq` and `docker-credential-ecr-login` binaries were removed from the Okteto's default pipeline runner image. If you need some of those binaries in your pipelines, you can build [your own runner image](admin/custom-installer-image.mdx).

### New Features

- We now allow the ability for admins of Okteto to [set the minimum accepted CLI version for their team](admin/dashboard.mdx#command-line-cli). This will apply for all users who are using CLI 3.2.0 and above <!-- 8829 -->
- We've published the [Okteto Manifest JSON Schema for inline suggestions and validation for creating and editing Okteto manifests within your code editor](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#validating-and-autocompleting-the-okteto-manifest-in-your-ide)
- Added support for [overwriting CLI images at the Helm chart level](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#cli)
- Shipped additional support for the installation of [Okteto in Air-Gapped Environments](self-hosted/manage/air-gapped.mdx) <!-- 8914 -->
- Configured buildkit probes to only accept requests when buildkit is healthy  <!-- 8871 -->
- Added support for configuring the [Okteto control plane jobs TTL at the helm level](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#jobs)  <!-- 8917 -->

### Improvements

- We've reorganized the [Admin Dashboard menu items](admin/dashboard.mdx) into groups for easier navigation  <!-- 8840 -->
- For [Catalog](admin/catalog.mdx) and [Cloud Credentials](admin/cloud-credentials/index.mdx) items that were created via CRDs, we've added "read-only" tags in the Dashboard to avoid confusion on which items can be edited in the UI <!-- 8886 -->
- Updated buildkit cacheRatio default value to `0.5`  <!-- 8921 -->
- The Okteto installer image is no longer needed, binaries for the installer jobs are now installed from `okteto/backend` <!-- 8767 -->
- [Okteto CLI 3.2.1](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1): We merged `okteto/bin` and `okteto/busybox` images into the `okteto/okteto` image to reduce the number of images used in the CLI workflow
- [Okteto CLI 3.2.1](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1): You can now define the Admin Variable `OKTETO_DEV_PERSISTENT_VOLUME_SIZE` to configure the default volume size for Development Containers

### Bug Fixes

- Added `globals.priorityClassName` to sleep/wake jobs and the `events-exporter` component  <!-- 8846 -->
- Added new logic to filter out terminated containers from Resource Manager calculations <!-- 8847 -->
- Redacted service accounts from our diagnostics package  <!-- 8922 -->
- [Okteto CLI 3.2.1](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1): Fixed a problem when deploying a compose with failed health checks. We were not taking into account the timeout operation, so the deploy operation was stuck forever


## 1.26.1

12 November 2024

This version is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.27 to 1.30

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the calculation of the total requested CPU/memory in Resource Manager Admin View by excluding completed pods.
- Fixed an issue when Resource Manager was enabled in Manual mode and `quotas.limitranges.requests.limitRequestRatio` was also set.

## 1.26.0

9 November 2024

This version is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.27 to 1.30

### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-1.26}
Please read the following changes before upgrading to 1.26

- **ACTION REQUIRED: Hostname Length Limit**\
Deployments now fail if a service hostname exceeds 63 characters, and an error message is shown. This limit is automatically applied to all resources. Previously, dev environments could deploy successfully even if endpoints didn’t work. This change may affect environments that deployed without issues before.
- **Helm Release Name Limit**:\
Helm release names are now limited to 63 characters. While this limit is automatically enforced for most resources, the `DefaultBackend` service can still fail during installation if its name exceeds this limit. \
To avoid installation errors, use the `defaultBackend.nameOverride` setting to shorten the `DefaultBackend` service name. If you need to rename the `DefaultBackend` during an upgrade,[follow this guide as it may impact the installation](https://www.okteto.com/docs/1.26/self-hosted/helm-configuration/#manual-migration-steps-when-renaming-the-defaultbackend-service).
- **Private Repository Deploys**: Deploying private repositories now uses the Okteto backend as the SSH agent, rather than mounting the local SSH agent. This change ensures feature parity between remote and local deploys but may impact scenarios where private repositories are cloned as part of commands defined in the deploy section during remote execution
- **Buildkit Persistence Enabled**: Buildkit persistence is now enabled by default, with a 100Gi disk and cache set to 90% of the disk size. If you previously used `buildkit.persistence.cache`, adjust to the new ratio, as this setting is no longer applicable

### New Features

- **[Introducing the Okteto Resource Manager](admin/resource-manager.mdx)**: a new feature that automatically optimizes CPU and memory requests for your environments. By analyzing real-time resource utilization, the Resource Manager dynamically adjusts resource requests to ensure efficient usage, prevent node overload, and improve overall cluster performance. This feature simplifies resource management, reduces manual adjustments, and enhances application stability, especially in larger clusters. The default installation provides recommendations but doesn't apply them automatically. [See our docs for details on how to apply these automatically](admin/resource-manager.mdx)
- Added Okteto [Garbage Collector settings to the Admin Dashboard](admin/cleanup.mdx): Admins can now manage sleep and delete periods from the Dashboard, with the ability to set different configurations for Namespaces and Preview Environments
- [Remote Execution can now be set as the default](core/remote-execution.mdx) in the Okteto Admin Dashboard, allowing admins to enforce consistent remote deploys. Remote deploys also include improvements for feature parity with local deploys, such as the ability to specify the context synchronization folder and private Git repository cloning during deploy commands using SSH keys
- Added additional feature and documentation for [running Buildkit at scale](self-hosted/manage/buildkit-high-performance.mdx)  <!-- 8727 -->

### Improvements

- Okteto will now automatically create a Docker secret if one doesn't already exist in the Controller Manager. This prevents a misleading warning that was being displayed in some scenarios when deploying from the UI  <!-- 8566 -->
- [Buildkit cache size is now automatically configured](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#buildkit) based on its PVC volume size  <!-- 8723 -->
- Removed Buildkit persistency as an installation step now that it defaults to true  <!-- 8771 -->
- The Okteto frontend now runs rootless by default, while Buildkit operates without privileges when rootless mode is enabled  <!-- 8774, 8800 -->
- We've [released Okteto CLI 3.1.0 with many new improvements](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0)
- [Okteto CLI 3.1.0](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0): Added support for a `context` field in the Okteto Manifest, allowing you to specify the working directory for commands in the `deploy` and `destroy` sections
- [Okteto CLI 3.1.0](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0): [Added automatic retry for build operations](reference/feature-flags.mdx) when BuildKit is unavailable due to transient errors. The behavior can be controlled using the environment variables `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_MAX_RETRIES_FOR_TRANSIENT_ERRORS`, `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, and `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_RETRY_INTERVAL`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that was preventing Development Environments to be destroyed when the specified manifest doesn't exist  <!-- 8760 -->
- Fixed a patch operation in the Okteto Insights cronjob that was causing the loss of node labels when there were concurrent operations from external processes  <!-- 8782 -->
- Resolved an issue where build logs were not displayed in the UI when deploying dev or preview environments, causing the UI to appear frozen. Build logs now display correctly during deployments


## 1.25.0

26 April 2024

This version is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.29

### Deprecation Notice

- Support for Kubernetes [1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Improvements

- Okteto CLI: the scope of the breaking change introduced in 1.19.0 has been reduced. `okteto deploy` will ignore host volumes of Docker Compose services only if the service defines a `build` section. [Please see our community post for more details](https://community.okteto.com/t/important-update-changes-to-docker-compose-deployment-behavior-in-okteto/1246)

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved a bug with migrations occurring during every Okteto upgrade. Tokens that were set to never expire were inadvertently being modified to expire in 180 days. This fix ensures that token expiration times are not altered during Okteto upgrades
