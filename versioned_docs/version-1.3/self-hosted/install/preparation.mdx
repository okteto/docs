## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you'll need the following:

- A domain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3
- A Bitbucket, GitHub, or Google OAuth application, or an OpenID Connect application
- Credentials of your Cloud Provider
- A bucket (or equivalent block storage)
- An Okteto License (optional)

### Domain

You'll need to have access to a domain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record.

This can be a root domain (e.g. example.com) or a subdomain (e.g. dev.example.com).
By default, Okteto creates a self-signed certificate to secure communication to the Okteto dashboard, the build service, the registry service, and to all the applications that use  [Automatic SSL Endpoints](https://okteto.com/docs/cloud/ssl/).
Follow [this guide](/docs/self-hosted/administration/certificates/) if you want to bring your own certificates.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow your cloud provider's Kubernetes cluster creation guide.
Okteto supports Kubernetes versions 1.21 through 1.23.

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.23
- A pool with at least 3 nodes with a minimum of 4CPUs and 16 GB of Memory
- 100 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.
 
### Installing kubectl

Follow the official Kubernetes documentation for [installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

Be sure to configure your kubectl to talk to your newly minted cluster.

### Installing Helm v3

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Authentication

Okteto uses OAuth for user authentication. It currently supports GitHub, Google, and OpenID Connect.

### Cloud Provider Account

Okteto needs to perform the following actions on your cloud provider:

1. Read and Write from block storage  (this is used when pulling and pushing images to the registry)

Please refer to the following documents on how to create the credentials in the different cloud providers:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="aws"
  values={[
    { label: 'Azure', value: 'azure', },
    { label: 'AWS', value: 'aws', },

#### Creating an Azure Storage Account

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) to create a storage account in your Azure Subscription. You'll use the access key when installing Okteto.

#### Creating a Storage Container

Okteto uses a Storage Container to store your private images. Follow Azures's [guide on how to create a storage container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html) and set its privacy level to private.

#### Registering your Domain

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns) to register your domain in Azure DNS.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="aws">

#### Registering your Domain

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html) to register your domain in Route53.

Register your domain using the same account used to create your EKS cluster.

#### Creating an S3 Bucket

Okteto uses S3 to store your private images. Follow Amazon's [guide on how to create s3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html). Create the bucket in the region as your EKS cluster, and keep it private.

#### Creating an IAM

The Okteto Registry needs access to S3 for uploading and downloading your container images.

We recommend you follow AWS' official documentation on [how to create and manage IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) for more information on this.

Create an `IAM User` with the following actions (replace `YOUR_BUCKET` with your `s3` bucket name):

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:ListBucket",
              "s3:GetBucketLocation",
              "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET"
      },
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:DeleteObject",
              "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
              "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/*"
      }
  ]
}
```

Once the `IAM User` is created, generate a set of Access keys and save them locally. You'll use the keys when installing Okteto.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="digitalocean">

#### Registering your Domain

Follow [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/add-domains/#:~:text=To%20add%20a%20domain%20from,field%2C%20then%20click%20Add%20Domain) to register your domain with DigitalOcean.

Register your domain using the same account used to create your DOK cluster.

#### Creating a DigitalOcean Space and Access Key

Okteto uses a Storage Space to store your private images. Follow DigitalOcean's [guide on how to create a storage space and api key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key). Create the space in the same region as your Kubernetes cluster and restrict file listing.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gcp">

#### Registering your Domain

Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/dns/zones/) to create a managed zone in your Google Cloud account.

Create it in the same project and region as your GKE cluster.

#### Creating a Google Cloud Storage Bucket

Okteto uses Google Cloud Storage to store your private images. Follow Google's [guide on how to create storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstart-console). Create the bucket in the same project and region as your GKE cluster, and keep it private.

#### Creating a Google Cloud Service Account

The Okteto Registry needs access to Cloud Storage for uploading and downloading your container images.

We recommend you follow Google's official documentation on [how to create and manage Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for more information on this.

You'll need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a `Service Account` in the same Google Cloud project as your GKE cluster.
1. Give it the `Storage Object Admin` roles.
1. Create a `JSON` key and save it locally. We'll be using this when installing Okteto.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You'll use the credentials when installing Okteto.

## Deploying Okteto

With the environment set up and configuration generated, you can now proceed to the [deployment of Okteto](/docs/self-hosted/install/deployment/).
