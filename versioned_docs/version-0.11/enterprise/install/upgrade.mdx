## Upgrading to 0.10.x

Due to changes in the official NGINX ingress chart name, the name of the NGINX ingress configuration key in the Helm configuration file has changed from `nginx-ingress` to `ingress-nginx`. Please update your [ingress-nginx](/docs/0.11/enterprise/administration/configuration/#ingress-nginx) configuration, if required, before upgrading your Okteto Enterprise instance.

Note that upgrading to 0.10.x **will recreate your NGINX ingress load balancer**.  Depending on your cloud provider and load balancer's configuration, the new load balancer might have a new IP assigned. If this is the case, you'll need to update the DNS entry of your Okteto Enterprise instance accordingly.

##  Upgrade your Okteto Enterprise Instance

Upgrade the CRDs:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://charts.okteto.com/crds.yaml
```

To upgrade a new release, modify the `config.yaml` with your desired changes and then use:

```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade <your-release-name> okteto/okteto-enterprise -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version <version_number>
```

For example:
```console
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade enterprise okteto/okteto-enterprise -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --version 0.9.x
```
*You can use `helm ls` to find the name of your release.*

Please review [the release notes](/docs/0.11/enterprise/install/releases/) before upgrading. New features, known issues, and configuration changes will be listed there.
