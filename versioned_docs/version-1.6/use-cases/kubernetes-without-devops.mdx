Let’s be honest, Kubernetes is not easy to learn, and it can require a dedicated team to operate and manage. 
It’s not feasible to assume that all your software engineers are going to be Kubernetes experts, 
but they do need access to Kubernetes in order to have a truly production-like development environment. 

That’s where Okteto can help. 
Get a realistic development environment for each engineer on your team, onboard new hires quickly, 
preview environments, give each developer their own Kubernetes namespace, 
garbage collection of unused namespaces and know that if it works in Okteto, it will work in production.
