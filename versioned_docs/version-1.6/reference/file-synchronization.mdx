When you run `okteto up`, an instance of [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), a file synchronization service, will be automatically started to keep your local files synchronized with your development container.

Syncthing provides a web UI to show the state of the file synchronization. You can get the syncthing endpoints and credentials of your development container by running `okteto status --info`:

```console
$ okteto status --info
```

```console
 i  Local syncthing url: http://localhost:60539
 i  Remote syncthing url: http://localhost:60538
 i  Syncthing username: okteto
 i  Syncthing password: ac0ee34a-b1aa-4a41-bc67-cec3128b6cfd
 âœ“  Synchronization status: 100.00%
```

###  Ignoring files

If some files should not be synchronized between your local machine and your development environment, a file called `.stignore` can be created containing file patterns to ignore.
The `.stignore` file must be placed in the root of the folder.

> The `okteto init` command will create a default `.stignore` tailored to the typical use cases of your programming language.

The `.stignore` file contains a list of files or path patterns.
The _first pattern_ that matches will decide the fate of a given file.
The patterns follow the same syntax that `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.
More information on this [is available here](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html).
