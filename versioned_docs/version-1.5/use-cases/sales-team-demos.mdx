Your sales team is probably not full of full-stack developers, nor would you want it to be. Problem is, when your sales team is responsible for demoing your product to prospects, it can be difficult for them to customize software to show off how your product would work for your potential customer.

Thatâ€™s where Okteto can help. Rather than needing to know Kubernetes, Docker, or understand a host of microservices, you can set your sales team up for success by giving them a tool that allows them to easily launch a production-like environment for a potential customer and show them the capabilities. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and we think a realistic demo could be worth even more when it comes to showcasing what your product can do.
