id: configuration
---

## General Settings

### email

The email of the application owner.

```yaml
email: "admin@example.com"
```

### cluster

- `endpoint`: The public endpoint of your Kubernetes cluster. It will be used by Okteto when generating `Kubeconfig` credentials for your users.

```yaml
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://52.30.32.1"
```

### license

Okteto is free for small teams. You can manage up to 3 users without having to provide a license.

```yaml
license: XXXXX
```

Want to use Okteto with a bigger team? [Let's talk](https://okteto.com/#talktous)

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/install/deployment.mdx#cloud-provider-secret) to store the license.

### subdomain

The domain (or subdomain) managed by Okteto.

Your Okteto instance will be available at `okteto.$SUBDOMAIN`. All ingresses created by okteto will use it as well (e.g. https://app-$NAMESPACE.$SUBDOMAIN)

```yaml
subdomain: "example.com"
```

After installation, we recommend that you create a DNS entry for `*.$SUBDOMAIN`, pointing to the public address of your load balancer.

### auth

Okteto supports using Bitbucket, GitHub, Google, or OpenID Connect as authentication providers.

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/install/deployment.mdx#cloud-provider-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

#### Bitbucket

Follow Bitbucket's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth Consumer](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/).

When creating the OAuth Consumer, you will need to provide the following values:

**Callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

**URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Permissions**:
Account: Email
Account: Read

Use this group of settings when using Bitbucket OAauth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  bitbucket:
    enabled: true
    clientId: OAauth Consumer Key
    clientSecret: OAauth Consumer Secret
    workspace: my-workspace
```

The `workspace` field is optional. Only members of the workspace will be allowed to login into your Okteto instance. An empty `workspace` field permits any user to log in.

#### GitHub

Follow GitHub's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

When creating the OAuth App, you will need to provide the following values:

**Homepage URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorization callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

Use this group of settings when using GitHub OAuth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  github:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientID
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    organization: my-org
```

The `organization` field is optional. Only members of the organization will be allowed to log in into your Okteto instance. An empty `organization` field permits any user to log in.

#### Google

Follow Google's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth 2.0 Client](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

When creating the OAUTH 2.0 Client, you will need to provide the following values:

**Authorized javascript origin**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

Use this group of settings when using Google OAuth as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  google:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    allowDomains:
    - example.com
```

The `allowDomains` field is optional. Only users with Google Workspace accounts that match one of the domains on the list will be allowed to log into your Okteto instance. An empty `allowDomains` field permits any user with a valid Google Workspace account to log in.

#### OpenID Connect

Follow your OpenID Connect service provider's documentation on how to create the required application.

When creating the application, you'll need to provide the following values:

- Start SSO URL:  `https://okteto.DOMAIN`
- Redirect URIs: `https://okteto.DOMAIN`, `https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback`
- Scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`
- Response Type: `code`
- Grant Type: `authorization code`

Use this group of settings when using an OpenID Connect provider as your authentication provider.

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: clientid
    clientSecret: clientSecret
    group: my-group
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://your-provider
      authorization: https://your-provider/authorization
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
      groupsKey: groups
```

The `group` field is optional. Only members of the group will be allowed to log in into your Okteto instance. An empty `group` field permits any user to log in.

The `issuer` and `authorization` endpoints must match the value returned in the provider config discovery.

The `mapping` fields are optional. Use them to configure the mapping between Okteto's user attributes and the claim coming from your authentication provider.

> Your provider needs to support the [UserInfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) in order to be used with Okteto. This authentication option follows the OpenID standard, and it has been validated with Okta, PingIdentity, and GitLab.

### cloud

Okteto integrates with different cloud providers to store the [Okteto Registry](cloud/registry.mdx) images.

> The sensitive part of the credentials are not included in the configuration file. Instead, it is provided to Okteto via [a secret](self-hosted/install/deployment.mdx#cloud-provider-secret).

#### Azure

Use this to use Azure Storage to store your private images.

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    azure:
      enabled: true
      storage:
        container: "Storage Container Name"
        accountName: "Storage Account Name"
```

The storage setting will be used by the registry to pull and push images (if [using cloud storage](#registry)). This needs to be created before installing Okteto.

#### AWS

Use this to use S3 to store your private images.

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    aws:
      enabled: true
      bucket: "Bucket Name"
      region: "AWS region"
      iam:
        enabled: true
        accessKeyID: "IAM Access Key"
```
The bucket will be used by the registry to pull and push images (if [using cloud storage](#registry)). This needs to be created before installing Okteto.

#### Digitalocean

Use this to use DigitalOcean Spaces to store your private images.

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    digitalocean:
      enabled: true
      space:
        name:
        accessKeyID:
```

The space settings will be used by the registry to pull and push images (if [using cloud storage](#registry)). This needs to be created before installing Okteto.

#### GCP

Use this to use Google Cloud Storage to store your private images.

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    gcp:
      enabled: true
      bucket: "Bucket Name"
      project: "Project ID"
      workloadIdentity:
        enabled: false
```

The bucket settings will be used by the registry to pull and push images (if [using cloud storage](#registry)). This needs to be created before installing Okteto.

#### BYO

Use this if you're using a provider not currently supported by Okteto.

```yaml
cloud:
  provider:
    byo:
      enabled: true
```

When using `byo` you'll need to [configure your registry](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#registry) to use the file system for storage.

```yaml
registry:
 storage:
   filesystem:
     enabled: true
     persistence:
       enabled: true
       size: 400Gi
   cloud:
     enabled: false
```

#### Advanced Cloud Scenarios

It is possible to use separate cloud providers for DNS than for storage if needed. [Reach out to support](https://okteto.com/support), we're always happy to help!

## Okteto Components

```

### autoscaler

The cluster autoscaler service. Disabled by default.
It instructs the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler to scale nodes if the real cpu/memory usage of a node is beyond the limits.

- `slackWebhook`: A slack webhook url to notify autoscaler events.
- `volumes.up`: Increase the cluster size when the Volumes in a node vs the max volumes per node is greater than or equal to this value. It defaults to 90 percent.
- `volumes.down`: Decrease the cluster size when the Volumes in a node vs the max volumes per node is lesser than this value. It defaults to 80 percent.


```yaml
autoscaler:
  enabled: false
  schedule: 300
  increment: 1
  min: 1
  max: 10
  cpu:
    up: 60

- `hpa.min`: Minimum number of buildkit pods to keep running.
- `hpa.max`: Maximum number of buildkit pods to scale to.
- `hpa.cpu`: The amount of CPU utilization that will cause the HPA to scale the buildkit pods.
- `labels`: Labels to add to the buildkit pods.
- `podManagementPolicy`: The [podManagementPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#pod-management-policies) of the buildkit pods. Defaults to `Parallel`.

      value: ".example.com"
  replicaCount: 1
  storage:
    class: ssd
    size: 180Gi
    cache: 150000
```

In order to handle timeouts during communication between the client and the buildkit daemon, the following environment variables can be modified on the server side:

- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_TIME_MS`: After this duration of time, if the server doesn't see any activity it pings the client to see if the transport is still alive. If set below 1s, a minimum value of 1s will be used. The current default value is 2 hours.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS`: After having pinged for keepalive check, the server waits for a duration of Timeout and if no activity is seen, the connection is closed. The current default value is 20 seconds.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_IDLE_MS`: Duration for the amount of time after which an idle connection would be closed by sending a GOAWAY. Idleness duration is defined since the most recent time the number of outstanding RPCs became zero or the connection establishment. The current default value is infinity.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_AGE_MS`: Duration for the maximum amount of time a connection may exist before it will be closed by sending a GOAWAY. A random jitter of +/-10% will be added to the value to spread out connection storms. The current default value is infinity.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_AGE_GRACE_MS`: An additive period after `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_MAX_CONN_AGE_MS` after which the connection will be forcibly closed. The current default value is infinity.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_POLICY_MINTIME_MS`: Minimum amount of time a client should wait before sending a keepalive ping. The current default value is 5 minutes.
- `OKTETO_KEEPALIVE_SERVER_POLICY_PERMIT_WITHOUT_STREAM`: If true, server allows keepalive pings even when there are no active streams(RPCs). If false, and client sends pings when there are no active streams, server will send GOAWAY and close the connection. False by default.

      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
```

### gc

The garbage collector service. It automatically scales idle applications to zero and deletes unused namespaces. Enabled by default.

- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the gc pods.
- `labels`: Labels to add to the gc pods.
- `scaleToZeroPeriod`: The duration, in hours, that an application or resource must be idle before the garbage collector scales it to zero. Set to zero to disable.
- `deleteNamespacePeriod`: The duration, in days, that a namespace must be idle before the garbage collector deletes it. Set to zero to disable.
- `slackWebhook`: If set, the garbage collector will send a notification when it scales a resource to zero or when it deletes a namespace.

```yaml
gc:
  enabled: true
  scaleToZeroPeriod: 24
  deleteNamespacePeriod: 15
  slackWebhook:
```

### installer

The jobs that deploy your [development environments from Git](cloud/deploy-from-git.mdx).

- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the installer job pods.

  sshSecretName: "okteto-ssh"
```

### registry

The private container registry.

- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the registry pods.
- `extraEnv`: Environment variables to be set on the registry containers.
- `ingress.annotations`: Annotations to add to the registry ingress. These annotations take precendence over the ones defined in the [ingress](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#ingress) section.
- `ingress.tlsSecret`: TLS secret for the registry endpoint. If empty, okteto will default to the wildcard certificate created by Okteto.
- `labels`: Labels to add to the registry pods.
- `pullPolicy`: The security policy for image pulls. If set to `cluster`, any Okteto user can pull any image from the registry. When set to `namespace`, only users with access to the namespace can pull images from the namespace. It defaults to `namespace`.
- `replicaCount`: The number of registry pods. It defaults to 1.
- `resources`: The resources for the registry pods.
- `serviceAccountName`: The service account used by the registry. It defaults to `default`.
- `storage`: The storage mechanism for the images.
  - `cloud.enabled`: Set this to true if you want to store the images using your cloud provider's block storage service (e.g. S3). It will use the values defined in the [`cloud` key](#cloud). It's enabled by default.

```yaml
registry:
  extraEnv:
    - name: NO_PROXY
      value: ".example.com"
  storage:
    cloud:
      enabled: true
```

  - `filesystem`: Set this to true if you want to store the images in PVC attached to the registry. This might limit your ability to scale up the registry, depending on the type of storage you are using. You can also customize the `storageClass`, the `size` of the volume, and even attach an existing volume claim via `claimName`.

```yaml
registry:
  storage:
    cloud:
      enabled: false
    filesystem:
      enabled: true
      persistence:
        claimName: ""
        accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
        storageClass: ""
        size: 40Gi
```

### telemetry

You can enable or disable the telemetry job. The telemetry job "phones home" once a day with the following information:

- Number of managed users
- Number of managed namespaces
- Kubernetes Version and Platform
- A unique install ID
- Your license ID.
- The name of the authentication provider
- The name of the cloud provider

Okteto uses the information to help us better understand how our customers use Okteto, as well as to help us prioritize fixes and features. We don't share your information with anyone else.

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```

If this configuration is disabled, Okteto CLI analytics are automatically disabled.

### webhook

The webhook service. Ingress creation, generation of hostnames, enforcement of policies, etc...

- `annotations`: Annotations to add to the webhook pods.
- `extraEnv`: Environment variables to be set on the webhook containers.
- `hostNetwork`: Enables or disables host networking for the webhook deployment. The default is false.
- `labels`: Labels to add to the webhook pods.
- `port`: Port sets the port used for the webhook deployment. The default is 443.
- `replicaCount`: The number of webhook pods. It defaults to 2.
- `resources`: The resources for the webhook pods.

## Advanced Configuration

### affinities

Apply default affinities to pods deployed in namespaces created by Okteto.

```yaml
affinities:
  devPool:
    - weight: 10
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: cloud.google.com/gke-preemptible
          operator: In
          values:
          - "true"
```

In this case, pods deployed in namespaces created by Okteto will have a preferred affinity to land on preemptible nodes.

### applications

- `repository`: The [Helm repository](cloud/deploy-from-helm.mdx) available for every developer. This is disabled by default. To enable, set the `applications.repository` property to your Helm registry URL

```yaml
applications:
  repository: "https://apps.okteto.com"
```

### clusterRole

Okteto assings this cluster role to every user via a namespace-scoped role binding.
The default value assigns each developer a `cluster-admin` role binding with only access to their personal namespaces.

```yaml
clusterRole: "cluster-admin"
```

### user extraRoleBindings

Extra `RoleBindings` to be created for every user's service account. This is useful if you want to grant access to resources in other namespaces of the cluster.  Disabled by default.

The `RoleBindings` will reference `ClusterRoles` and will be scoped to the `namespace` specified in the configuration. Okteto will not create neither the `ClusterRoles` nor the `Namespaces` and expects them to exist in the cluster. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
user: 
  extraRoleBindings:
    enabled: true
    roleBindings:
      namespace-name1:
      - cluster-role1
      - cluster-role2
      namespace-name2:
      - cluster-role3
```

### convertLoadBalancedServices

Converts services with type LoadBalancer into ClusterIP and automatically creates an ingress. Enabled by default.

```yaml
convertLoadBalancedServices:
  enabled: true
```

### devStorageClass

Uses the specified storage class for all persistent volume claims created when developers execute `okteto up`. This setting will override any storage class defined on the [Okteto manifest](reference/manifest.mdx#persistentvolume-object-optional). Disabled by default.

- `storageClass`: The storage class enforced for persistent volume claims created by `okteto up`.

```yaml
devStorageClass:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: ebs-sc
```

There is only one exception where this storage class is overwritten. In case of having [volume snapshots feature](self-hosted/administration/volume-snapshots.mdx) configured, if a storage class is required for the snapshots that storage class will have preference.

### globalClusterRole

Okteto assings this cluster role to every user via a cluster role binding. By default, this behavior is disabled.
This can be useful to give access to cluster level resources to every developer account, like accessing the Node API.

```yaml
globalClusterRole: ""
```

### ingress

Configure default values for the ingress created by Okteto.

- `annotations`: The annotations to apply to all the ingresses created during the Okteto installation.
- `oktetoIngressClass`: The `ingressClassName` to apply to all the ingresses created during the Okteto installation (defaults to `nginx`).
- `class`: If specified, Okteto will set this as the `ingressClassName` of all ingresses managed by Okteto. This is useful if you have more than one ingress controller in your cluster.
- `forceIngressClass`: If enabled, all ingresses deployed in namespaces managed by Okteto will have the ingress class defined in  `ingress.class` (default: `false`).
- `forceIngressSubdomain`: If enabled, the subdomain of the host of all ingresses deployed in namespaces managed by Okteto must match the okteto wildcard subdomain (default: `true`).
- `ip`: The internal IP of the ingress. Pods will call the Okteto API and the Okteto Registry using this IP. Required if the Okteto API/Registry is exposed using an ingress not managed by Okteto.
- `tlsSecret`: TLS secret for the ingress created by Okteto. If empty, okteto defaults to the wildcard certificate created by Okteto.

```yaml
ingress:
  annotations: {}
  oktetoIngressClass: nginx
  class: nginx
  forceIngressClass: false
  forceIngressSubdomain: true
  ip: ""
  tlsSecret: ""
```
### ingressLimits

Configure ingress connections limits for each public endpoint. Disabled by default.

- `connections`: Maximum parallel connections for each ingress.
- `rps`: Maximum requests per second for each ingress.
- `rpm`: Maximum requests per minute for each ingress.

```yaml
ingressLimits:
  enabled: true
  connections: 40
  rps: 40
  rpm: 400
```

### injectDevelopmentBinaries

Automatically inject kubectl, helm, and okteto binaries on every development environment, and on the git and helm deployment pipelines. This requires permissions to mount a host volume.

If this is disabled, you'll need to provide your own image in `installer.image`.

```yaml
injectDevelopmentBinaries:
  enabled: true
```

### namespace

Annotation and label customizations for namespaces.
The configured annotations and labels will be applied to each namespace created by Okteto.
These annotations and labels are additional to the ones already applied by Okteto.

- `annotations`: Annotations applied to each namespace generated by Okteto.
- `labels`: Labels applied to each namespace generated by Okteto.

```yaml
namespace:
  annotations:
    custom.annotation/one: one
    custom.annotation/two: two
  labels:
    custom.label/one: one
    custom.label/two: two
```

### networkPolicies

Configures [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) for each namespace to isolate network traffic.
Disabled by default.

- `blockedCIDRs`: Outgoing traffic to any cidr on this list will be blocked by the network policy (optional).

```yaml
networkPolicies:
  enabled: true
  blockedCIDRs:
  - "169.254.169.254/32"
```

### podSecurityPolicy

Decide if you want [pod security policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) to be added to the service accounts created by Okteto.

#### enabled

Whether to enable pod security policy (defaults to `true`).

#### useAppArmor

Add the apparmor security annotations to the Okteto pod security policies. (defaults to `true`).

If `true` the following annotations are added to the existing pod security policy:

```yaml
apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default
```

```yaml
podSecurityPolicy:
   enabled: true
   useAppArmor: true
```

### overrideFileWatchers

Overrides the default kernel values for file watchers in every node. Recommended if you're running databases, or if you plan on using "okteto up" on the cluster. This requires permission to mount and modify /proc values.

- `maxUserWatches`: The maximum number of allowed inotify watchers.
- `maxMapCount`: The maximum number of memory map areas a process may have.
- `aioMaxNR`: The maximum number of allowable concurrent IO requests.

```yaml
overrideFileWatchers:
  enabled: true
  maxUserWatches: 10048576
  maxMapCount: 262144
  aioMaxNR: 1000000
```

### overrideRegistryResolution

Overrides the registry hostname resolution to use internal IPs. This requires permission to mount and modify the cluster nodes' /etc/hosts file.

```yaml
overrideRegistryResolution:
  enabled: true
```

### prepullImages

Pre-pull the git and helm installer images in all the nodes. This requires permission to mount the docker socket.

```yaml
prepullImages:
  enabled: true
```

### privateRegistry

A list of private registries and its corresponding credentials. The kubelet will use them when pulling images:

```yaml
privateRegistry:
  hub:
    url: https://index.docker.io/v1/
    user: username1
    password: password1

You can use this to configure a Docker Hub account for your cluster in order to avoid DockerHub's pull limits.
Be careful, a credential misconfiguration could lead to an issue where kubelet cannot pull public images from Docker Hub.
If this happens, [follow these instructions](self-hosted/install/troubleshooting.mdx#private-image-registry-credentials-misconfiguration) to recover from this state.

### pullAlways

Forces the `PullAlways` image pull policy in the cluster. Enabled by default.

```yaml
pullAlways:
  enabled: true
```

### quickstarts

  - `maxPVCs`: Maximum number of persistent volume claims per namespace.
  - `maxVolumeSnapshots`: Maximum number of volume snapshots per namespace.
  - `maxIngresses`: Maximum number of ingresses per namespace
- `bandwidth`: Limits the incoming/outcoming bandwidth per pod. Requires using the Okteto [NGINX Ingress Controller](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#nginx-ingress).
  - `ingress`: Maximum ingress bandwidth.
  - `egress`: Maximum egress bandwidth.
  - `up`: Limits the incoming/outgoing bandwidth per development container.
    - `ingress`: Maximum ingress bandwidth for a development container
    - `egress`: Maximum egress bandwidth for a development container.
- `requests`: Limits the maximum [resource requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits) per namespace.
  - `cpu`: Maximum CPU resource requests.
  - `memory`: Maximum memory resource requests.
  - `storage`: Maximum storage resource requests.
- `limits`: Limits the maximum [resource limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits) per namespace.
  - `cpu`: Maximum CPU resource limits.

- `limitranges`: Configures the [limit ranges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/) of each namespace.
  - `max`: Configures the maximum resources per container.
    - `cpu`: Maximum CPU resource limits.
    - `memory`: Maximum memory resource limits.
  - `requests`: Configures the default resource requests per container.
    - `limitRequestRatio`: If this value is different than zero, Okteto automatically sets the requests of each container to its limits divided by this value. It is useful to keep requests low in the cluster and make better usage of your infrastructure. Defaults to 1000.
    - `cpu`: Default CPU resource requests. Ignored if `limitRequestRatio` is different than zero.
    - `memory`: Default memory resource requests.  Ignored if `limitRequestRatio` is different than zero.
  - `limits`: Configures the default resource limits per container.
    - `cpu`: Default CPU resource limits.
    - `memory`: Default memory resource limits.

The default values are:

```yaml
quotas:
  resources:
    enabled: false
    maxNamespaces: "3"
    maxPods: "20"
    maxServices: "20"
    maxReplicationControllers: "30"
    maxSecrets: "50"
    maxConfigMaps: "50"
    maxPVCs: "10"
    maxVolumeSnapshots: "10"
  bandwidth:
    enabled: false
    ingress: "800M"
    egress: "800M"
  requests:
    enabled: false
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2Gi"
    storage: "20Gi"
  limits:
    enabled: false
    cpu: "4"
    memory: "8Gi"
    storage: "20Gi"
  limitranges:
    max:
      enabled: false
      cpu: "3"
      memory: "12Gi"
    requests:
      enabled: true
      limitRequestRatio: 1000
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "0.2Gi"
    limits:
      enabled: true
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "8Gi"
```

### secret

Labels and annotations to include in the secret created by the chart. Useful if you want to integrate with Vault or similar secret stores.

```yaml
secret:
  annotations:
    your.custom.annotation: "10"
  labels:
    your.custom.label: "20"
```

### tolerations

Indicates [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for the okteto components.
Define the label and taint `okteto-node-pool` on your worker nodes to match these values.

- `oktetoPool`: Tolerations for the api, webhook, gc, autoscaler, ingress controller, and frontend services.
- `buildPool`: Tolerations for the buildkit and registry services.
- `devPool`: Tolerations for the pods deployed in namespaces created by okteto.

```yaml
tolerations:
  oktetoPool: okteto
  buildPool: build
  devPool: dev
```

For example, if you add the label `okteto-node-pool:build` and the taint `okteto-node-pool=build:NoSchedule` to a node, and you
are using `buildPool: build`, the buildkit and registry pods are deployed to this node.

### userDefinedNamespaces

Disable if you want to enforce using the `username` as a suffix on namespaces and ingress hosts. Enabled by default.

```yaml
userDefinedNamespaces: false
```

### userPodAffinity

When enabled Okteto automatically adds a preferred affinity to every pod, which leans towards placing pods from the same namespace and in the same node (default: `true`).

```yaml
userPodAffinity:
  enabled: true
```

### volumes

Allows you to specify different settings for volumes.

 - `validate`: Section to configure volume validation.
  - `enabled`: Enables volume validation. Disabled by default
  - `supportedStorageClasses`: List of supported storage classes.
  - `forceStorageClass`: Flag to specify if the storage class should be enforced in case of creating a volume with a non-supported storage class. If set, the first storage class specified on `supportedStorageClasses` will be the enforced value.
  - `supportedAccessModes`: List of supported access modes.

```yaml
volumes:
  validate:
    enabled: true
    supportedStorageClasses: ["standard", "standard-rwo"]
    forceStorageClass: true
    supportedAccessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
```

### volumeSnapshots

Enables users to initialize persistent volume claims with the contents of a preexisting volume snapshot.

This feature requires having a CSI driver installed in your cluster.

- `driver`: The name of the CSI driver used when creating snapshots.
- `class`: The VolumeSnapshotClass of the volume snapshot.
- `storageClass`: The storage class required by volumes initialized from snapshots (optional).
- `enableNamespaceAccessValidation`: When enabled, only users that have access to the namespace where the volume snapshot is stored will be able to use it in their development environments. Default false.
- `allowIDAnnotation`: Allow using your cloud provider's snapshot ID as the source of the data. Default true.

```yaml
volumeSnapshots:
  enabled: true
  driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
  class: snapclass
  storageClass: ebs-sc
```

Add the `dev.okteto.com/from-snapshot-id` annotation to any persistent volume claim to tell Okteto to initialize your persistent volume claim, as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/from-snapshot-id: snap-xxxxxxxx
  name: pvc-name
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

When a persistent volume claim resource is created, Okteto will import the snapshot in Kubernetes using a [VolumeSnapshotContent](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) and will set the source of your persistent volume claim to this VolumeSnapshotContent.

### wildcardCertificate

Disable if you want to bring your own certificates and/or certificate authority. Enabled by default.

- `create`: If set to false, Okteto will not create the wildcard certificate automatically.
- `duration`: The duration of the certificate. Ignored if `create` is set to `false`.
- `name`: The name of the secret where the certificate will be stored.
- `privateCA.enabled`: Set to true when using a private certificate authority.
- `privateCA.secret.name`: The name of the secret that stores the private certificate authority's certificate.
- `privateCA.secret.key`: The key in the secret that stores the private certificate authority's certificate.

```yaml
wildcardCertificate:
  create: true
  duration: 2160h0m0s
  name: default-ssl-certificate
  # if using a private CA, specify the name of the TLS secret that stores the certificate
  privateCA:
    enabled: false
    secret:
      name: "okteto-ca"
      key: "ca.crt"
```

### user

#### serviceAccount

The configured annotations and labels are additional to the ones already applied by Okteto.

- `annotations`: Annotations added to each service account generated by Okteto for user accounts.
- `labels`: Labels added to each service account generated by Okteto for user accounts.

```yaml
user:
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      custom.annotation/one: one
      custom.annotation/two: two
    labels:
      custom.label/one: one
      custom.label/two: two
```

A common use case for adding service account annotations is to [get access via IAM Roles or Workload Identity](https://community.okteto.com/t/support-for-gke-workload-identities-for-okteto-self-hosted/39/4) to create Cloud resources as part of your Okteto Manifest `deploy` commands.

- [Azure Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/)
- [GKE Workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
- [AWS IAM Roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)


## Dependencies

Okteto will automatically install [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) as part of the default installation, using its official [Helm chart](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx).

### NGINX-Ingress

Use the `ingress-nginx` keys in your configuration file to modify the configuration.

For example, to change the number of replicas, you'd need to add the following:

```yaml
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    replicaCount: 2
```

The full list of values is [available here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/charts/ingress-nginx/values.yaml).
