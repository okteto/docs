This section explains how to download your Kubernetes credentials and start developing your applications in Okteto with your favorite CLI tools.

The first thing you need to do is install the Okteto CLI and ensure the executable is in your PATH. This is needed because the kubeconfig provided by Okteto uses a [credential plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) to authenticate access your Kubernetes cluster. It is a common pattern used by many Kubernetes providers, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to connect to Kubernetes clusters.

If this is your first time using the Okteto CLI, install it following [this guide](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx). After completing those steps, the Okteto CLI should be in your PATH.

The next thing you need to do is to configure your Okteto context to point to your Okteto instance. To do this, run the `okteto context` command:

```console
$ okteto context use https://okteto.example.com
```

```console
Authentication will continue in your default browser
 âœ“  Context 'okteto.example.com' created
```

If you're not logged into Okteto yet, it will also run the login sequence.

Now that you have installed Okteto CLI and it is connected to your Okteto instance, you can download the Kubernetes credentials. There are two different ways of doing so:

- Download your Kubernetes credentials [using the Okteto CLI](#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-using-the-okteto-cli).

- Download your Kubernetes credentials [from the Okteto dashboard](#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-from-the-okteto-dashboard).

## Download your Kubernetes credentials using the Okteto CLI

Having your Okteto context configured to access Okteto, run the following command:

```console
$ okteto kubeconfig
```

```console
Updated kubernetes context 'example_okteto_com/cindylopez' in '/Users/cindylopez/.kube/config'
```

The `okteto kubeconfig` command adds your Kubernetes credentials to your kubeconfig file, and sets it as the current Kubernetes context.
Once you do this, you'll have full access to your Kubernetes namespace with `kubectl`, `helm` or any other CLI tool.

## Download your Kubernetes credentials from the Okteto dashboard

From the Okteto dashboard you should also find your credentials in the `Settings > Setup` section.

Once downloaded, point your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the credentials file:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac-linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'MacOS / Linux', value: 'mac-linux', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="mac-linux">

```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/Downloads/okteto-kube.config:${KUBECONFIG:-$HOME/.kube/config}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```console
> $Env:KUBECONFIG=("$HOME\Downloads\okteto-kube.config;$Env:KUBECONFIG;$HOME\.kube\config")
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

To see that the new configuration is working, enter this command:

```console
$ kubectl get all
```
```console
No resources found.
```

## Using your Kubernetes credentials

Once you've downloaded your credentials, you'll have full access to your Kubernetes namespaces on Okteto directly from your terminal, using the tools you're already familiar with, such as `helm`, `kubectl`, `okteto` or `skaffold`.

For example, you could use `kubectl` to deploy our `hello-world` application:

```terminal
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okteto/go-getting-started/master/k8s.yml
```

[Credential plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) are a way of managing Kubernetes cluster credentials in a more secure way as you get time-bound tokens for your service account instead of using auto-generated secret-based ones. If you prefer to use static, auto-generated tokens you can do so by setting the environment variable `OKTETO_USE_STATIC_KUBETOKEN` to `true` before running any Okteto command. Be aware that using static tokens is not recommended by Kubernetes and you will receive warnings in your `kubectl` output from version `1.27` onward encouraging you to stop using them.
