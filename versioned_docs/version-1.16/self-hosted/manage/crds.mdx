As part of Okteto's installation, some Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed in your cluster. These CRDs are used by Okteto to mainly store different information. You can see the list of CRDs installed by Okteto exploring the folder `crds` in the templates of the [Okteto Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/okteto/okteto) or by running the following command in your cluster:

```console
kubectl get crd | grep okteto.com
```

You can let Okteto install these CRDs or you can install them manually on your own, but be aware they are needed for Okteto to work properly. You can use the [following configuration setting](reference/helm-chart-values.mdx/#crds) to let Okteto know if it should install them or not. By default, Okteto will install them.

## Private Registries

In Okteto version `1.14` we've changed the way private registry configuration is managed. In `1.14` onward you must configure private registries via the [Admin dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx/#registry-credentials) or by defining them directly in your cluster through one of the CRDs installed by Okteto: `admin.okteto.com`. This last case is useful, for example, if you have your own mechanism to provision credentials/secrets in your cluster.

If you prefer to define the registries directly in your cluster, you can do it by creating an [Opaque Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret) in the cluster with the data needed for the registry. Depending on the type of registry, you will need different fields.

Once the secret is created, you will need to create a resource with the apiVersion `admin.okteto.com/v1`, which is one of the CRDs installed by Okteto, referring to the secret which contains the credentials.

If you want to define static credentials (username and password) for a private registry you need to create a secret in the Okteto namespace with the username and password to be used. Once created, you need to define a CRD using the name of the resource as the hostname of the registry (e.g. `index.docker.io` or `111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`).  For example, if you want to add a configuration for Docker's registry, you will need to create a resource like this:

:::note
Defining the port through `spec.static.port` is optional and only available for static registries. It should only be used if the registry listens on a port other than the default http(s) 80/443
:::

:::note
If you are using custom ports, make sure to run Okteto Chart >=1.14.2
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  name: index.docker.io # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  static:
    port: 5000 # optional
    passwordSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the password
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the password is stored
    userSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the username
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the username is stored
```

In the case of AWS, where you have to specify the Access Key and Access Secret, the process is similar to the static credentials one. You will need to create a secret with those values, and then, create a CRD like this (the name of the resource has to be the hostname of the registry to be configured and it has to end with `.amazonaws.com`):

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  name: 111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  awsIamUser:
    accessKeyIDSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access key is stored
    secretAccessKeySecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access secret key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access secret is stored
```

:::note
Any changes you make to credentials can take a few minutes to propagate to all components in the cluster. To make sure Okteto is able to access the registries, you can check in the [Admin dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx/#registry-credentials). If you add credentials using CRDs they will be displayed in the UI, but they can't be modified from the UI. If you want to manage them from the UI, they must be created from there.
