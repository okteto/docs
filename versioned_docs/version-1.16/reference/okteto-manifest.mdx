`okteto.yaml` is a manifest format for describing development environments.

The Okteto Manifest has three main sections: `build`, `deploy` and `dev`, to define how to build, deploy and develop your development environment.

## Example

```yaml
build:
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - api:/usr/src/app
  frontend:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - frontend:/usr/src/app
```

## Schema reference

### build (object, optional)

A list of images to build as part of your development environment.

```yaml
build:
  base:
    context: .
  api:
    context: api
  frontend:
    context: frontend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    target: dev
    depends_on: base
    args:
      SOURCE_IMAGE: ${OKTETO_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE}
    secrets:
      npmrc: .npmrc
```

Each image supports the following fields:

- `image`: the name of the image to build and push. In clusters that have Okteto installed, this is optional (if not specified, the [Okteto Registry](core/components/container-registry.mdx) is used).
- `context`: the build context. Relative paths are relative to the location of the Okteto Manifest (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It's a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the [multi-stage official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on.
- `secrets`: list of secrets exposed to the build. The value of each secret refers to a file. Okteto will resolve references containing a `$` sign in this fileto the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on.
- `export_cache`: image tag for exported cache when build.
- `cache_from`: list of images to import cache from.
- `depends_on`: list of images that need to be built first.

You can build all these images by running `okteto build`, or `okteto build xxx` to build a single one.

Follow this document for a list of [environment variables](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx#built-in-environment-variables) available in your deploy commands to refer to the images built in the `build` section of your Okteto Manifest.

> Okteto will automatically add all the build environment variables from all previous images in the dependency chain as build arguments. To refer to them, remember to add the `ARG` instruction on your Dockerfile.

### context (string, optional)

The okteto context when the development environment is deployed. By default, it uses the current okteto context.

For example, to force that your development environment is always created on your _minikube_ context, you can define:

```yaml
context: minikube
```

You can use an environment variable to replace the context field, or any part of it:

```yaml
context: $DEV_CONTEXT
```

### dependencies ([string], optional)

A list of repositories you want to deploy as part of your development environment.

> `dependencies` is only supported in clusters that have Okteto installed.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
```

Follow this document for a list of [environment variables](reference/okteto-cli.mdx#deploy) available in your deploy commands to refer to `variables` of your `dependencies`.

Use `okteto deploy --dependencies` to force the redeployment of your dependencies.

There is also an extended notation to configure how to deploy your dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
    manifest: okteto.yaml
    branch: main
    variables:
      ENVIRONMENT: development
      DEBUG: true
    wait: true
    timeout: 15m
```

Or:

```yaml
dependencies:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/movies-frontend
    manifest: okteto.yaml
    branch: main
    variables:
      - ENVIRONMENT: development
      - DEBUG: true
    wait: true
    timeout: 15m
```

When specifying the manifest path, the dependency deployment will use this path where the manifest is defined as the context.

### deploy ([string], optional)

A list of commands to deploy your development environment.

It's usually a combination of `helm`, `kubectl`, and `okteto` commands.

#### Deploy with Custom Commands

For example, deploy a Helm chart using a custom command invoking the `helm` CLI:

```yaml
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

You can name your commands with the following syntax:

```yaml
deploy:
  - name: Deploy Movies App with Helm
    command: helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

You can share environment variables between steps by adding them to `$OKTETO_ENV`:

```yaml
deploy:
  - name: Set env value
    command: echo "OKTETO_FOLDER=/app" >> $OKTETO_ENV
  - name: Get env value
    command: echo "$OKTETO_FOLDER" # Prints /app
```

Follow this document for a list of [environment variables](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx#built-in-environment-variables) available in your deploy commands.

#### Deploy with Docker Compose

Deploy a Docker Compose file using the following notation:

```yaml
deploy:
  compose: docker-compose.yml
```

There is an extended notation to deploy several Docker Compose files and [endpoints](reference/docker-compose.mdx#endpoints-object-optional):

```yaml
deploy:
  compose:
    - file: docker-compose.yml
      services:
        - frontend
    - file: docker-compose.dev.yml
      services:
        - api
  endpoints:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 80
    - path: /api
      service: api
      port: 8080
```

The `services` field allows us to deploy only a subset of the services in the Docker compose file (default to all services).
Only the `volumes` and `endpoints` of the services specified in the `services` field are deployed.

You can combine deploy commands with Docker Compose files:

```yaml
deploy:
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
  compose: docker-compose.yml
```

Your deploy commands will be executed before deploying your Docker Compose files.

#### Divert

Divert is useful when you have many services and you only want to deploy a subset of them in your development environment, while connecting these services with a shared environment that runs all your microservices.

When divert is enabled, Okteto adds the header `baggage.okteto-divert` to every request coming from the developer namespace.
If the request reaches the shared namespace and matches a diverted virtual service, Okteto redirects the request back to the developer namespace.

To divert a virtual service as part of your development environment, use the following notation:

```yaml
deploy:
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
  divert:
    driver: istio
    virtualServices:
      - name: vs1
        namespace: staging
        routes:
          - route1
          - route2
    hosts:
      - virtualService: frontend
        namespace: staging
```

- `driver`: the backend for divert. Currently, the only supported driver is `istio`.
- `virtualServices`: a list of virtual services to divert. Each virtual service is defined with it's name, namespace, and an optional list of routes to be diverted. By default, all routes are diverted.
- `hosts`: the list of hosts you want to divert in the developer namespace. Requests to these virtual services will have the header `baggage.okteto-divert` injected.

#### Deploy remotely

Using the `--remote` flag lets you run the `okteto deploy` commands directly in your Okteto cluster. 

If you define an image in the okteto manifest, `okteto deploy` will always run in remote mode. If you don't define an image, and you run in remote mode, okteto will use a [default container image](https://github.com/okteto/pipeline-runner).

```yaml
deploy:
  image: okteto/pipeline-runner:1.0.0
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

With this, you don't have to worry about installing tools like `helm`, `kubectl`, and others on your local machine. Instead, you define a container image with all your tools and you, and everyone else on your team, get the same experience with zero configuration required.

When running on remote, Okteto will automatically synchronize your local folder. Okteto looks for a file named `.oktetodeployignore` in your local folder. If this file exists, the CLI will exclude any files and directories that match patterns in it. This helps to avoid unnecessarily synchronizing large or sensitive files and directories that are not used by the commands defined in the `deploy` section. `.oktetodeployignore` uses the same format that [.dockerignore files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file).

You can explicitly set the `remote` field in the `deploy` section without using the `--remote` flag:

```yaml
deploy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set api.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE} --set frontend.image=${OKTETO_BUILD_FRONTEND_IMAGE}
```

### destroy ([string], optional)

A list of commands to destroy external resources created by your development environment.

`okteto destroy` automatically takes care of destroying all the Kubernetes resources created by `okteto deploy`.

Use the `destroy` section if you create resources out of the scope of Kubernetes, like s3 buckets or RDS databases.

```yaml
destroy:
  - terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

Follow this document for a [list of variables](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx#built-in-environment-variables) available in your destroy commands.

#### Destroy remotely

Using the `--remote` flag lets you run the okteto destroy commands directly in your Okteto cluster. When executing okteto destroy with this flag, Okteto will automatically synchronize your local folder, and then it will run the destroy section of the manifest directly in your Okteto cluster, using the image defined in the manifest.

If you define an image in the okteto manifest, `okteto destroy` will always run in remote mode. If you don't define an image, and you run in remote mode, okteto will use a [default container image](https://github.com/okteto/pipeline-runner).

```yaml
destroy:
  image: okteto/pipeline-runner:1.0.0
  commands:
    - terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

With this, you don't have to worry about installing tools like `helm`, `kubectl`, and others on your local machine. Instead, you define a container image with all your tools and you, and everyone else on your team, get the same experience with zero configuration required.

When running on remote, Okteto will automatically synchronize your local folder. Okteto looks for a file named `.oktetodeployignore` in your local folder. If this file exists, the CLI will exclude any files and directories that match patterns in it. This helps to avoid unnecessarily synchronizing large or sensitive files and directories that are not used by the commands defined in the `destroy` section. `.oktetodeployignore` uses the same format that [.dockerignore files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file).

You can explicitly set the `remote` field in the `destroy` section without using the `--remote` flag:

```yaml
destroy:
  remote: true
  commands:
    - terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

### dev (object, optional)

A list of development containers to define the behavior of [okteto up](reference/okteto-cli.mdx#up) and synchronize your code in your development environment.

```yaml
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - api:/usr/src/app
  frontend:
    command: yarn start
    sync:
      - frontend:/usr/src/app
```

The `name` of each development container must match the name of the Kubernetes Deployment or Statefulset that you want to put on development mode.
If the name of your Deployment or Statefulset is dynamicly generated, use the [selector](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#selector-mapstringstring-optional) field to match the Deployment or Statefulset by labels.

Each development container supports the following fields:

#### affinity (Affinity, optional)

Affinity allows you to constrain which nodes your development container is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: role
              operator: In
              values:
                - web-server
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

More information about affinity is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

#### autocreate (bool, optional)

If set to true, `okteto up` creates a deployment if `name` doesn't match any existing deployment in the current namespace (default: `false`).

#### command (string, optional)

Sets the command of your development container. If empty, it defaults to `sh`:

```yaml
command: bundle exec thin -p 3000
```

The command can also be a list:

```yaml
command: ["bundle", "exec", "thin", "-p", "3000"]
```

#### container (string, optional)

The name of the container in your deployment you want to put on development mode. By default, it takes the first one.

#### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables to your development container. If a variable already exists on your deployment, it will be overridden with the value specified on the manifest.

Environment variables with only a key, or with a value with a `$` sign resolve to their values on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

```yaml
environment:
  environment: development
  name: user-${USER:peter} ## will be replaced by the value of $USER or by "peter" if the the variable USER doe not exist
  DBPASSWORD: ## will be given the value of $DBPASSWORD if it exists
```

##### envFiles

Add environment variables to your development container from a file.

```yaml
envFiles:
  - .env1
  - .env2
```

Environment variables declared in the environment section override these values.

#### externalVolumes ([string], optional)

A list of persistent volume claims (not managed by okteto) that you want to mount in your development container.
This is useful to share cache information between different development containers.
For example, to share the go cache between different development containers, you could define:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - go-cache:/root/.cache/go-build/
```

on different okteto manifests. You can also mount a relative subpath of a given peristent volume claim:

```yaml
externalVolumes:
  - pvc-name:subpath:/var/lib/mysql
```

#### forward ([string], optional)

A list of ports to forward from your development container.
The list should follow the `localPort:remotePort` notation and each element should be unique.

You can also access other services running in your namespace by using the notation `localPort:remoteService:remotePort`.

```yaml
forward:
  - 8080:80
  - 5432:postgres:5432
```

You can also use the extended notation below to configure the service to be exposed using a label selector or its name.

```yaml
forward:
  - localPort: 8080
    remotePort: 80
    name: app
  - localPort: 5432
    remotePort: 5432
    labels:
      app: db
```

Once your development container is up and running, you will be able to access the port directly by using `localhost:localPort`.

> Common uses of port forwarding are:
>
> 1.  Access a service via `localhost` instead of via an ingress
> 1.  Remote debugging
> 1.  Connect to a hot reloader via a websocket

If Okteto can't forward a port (typically because they are already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.

#### initContainer (object, optional)

Allows you to override the okteto init container configuration of your development container.

```yaml
initContainer:
  image: okteto/bin:1.2.22
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 30m
      memory: 30Mi
```

#### interface (string, optional)

Port forwards and reverse tunnels will be bound to this address. Defaults to `localhost`.

```yaml
interface: 0.0.0.0
```

#### image (string, optional)

Sets the docker image of your development container. Defaults to the image specified in your deployment.

> More information on development images [here](deploy/development-environments.mdx)

You can use an environment variable to replace the image, or any part of it:

```yaml
image: okteto/dev:$USER
```

> More information on how to use private images for your development container [is available here](reference/faqs.mdx#how-to-use-private-images).

#### imagePullPolicy (string, optional)

The image pull policy of your development environment (default: `Always`)

#### lifecycle (boolean, optional)

If set to true, postStart and postStop lifecycle events are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
More information about lifecycle events is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which events to enable/disable:

```yaml
lifecycle:
  postStart: false
  postStop: true
```

- `postStart`: specifies if the postStart event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `postStop`: specifies if postStop event is enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

#### metadata (object, optional)

The metadata field allows to inject labels and annotations into your development container.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    fluxcd.io/ignore: "true"
  labels:
    custom.label/dev: "true"
```

#### nodeSelector (map[string]string, optional)

List of labels that the node must have to include the development container on it.

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
```

More information about nodeSelector is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

#### persistentVolume (object, optional)

Allows you to configure the okteto persistent volume:

- `enabled`: enable/disable the use of persistent volumes (default: `true`)
- `storageClass`: the storage class of the volume (default: the `default` storage class)
- `size`: the size of the okteto persistent volume (default: `2Gi`)

```yaml
persistentVolume:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: standard
  size: 30Gi
```

Note the following limitations:

- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [services](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#services-object-optional).
- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you use [volumes](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#volumes-string-optional).
- `persistentVolume.enabled` must be `true` if you want to share command history across development containers while developing an app.

#### probes (boolean, optional)

If set to true, liveness, readiness, and start probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

More information about probes is [available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

Use the extended notation below to have more control over which probes to enable/disable:

```yaml
probes:
  liveness: true
  readiness: true
  startup: true
```

- `liveness`: specifies if liveness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `readiness`: specifies if readiness probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).
- `startup`: specifies if startup probes are enabled when running `okteto up` (default: `false`).

#### resources (object, optional)

Allows you to override the resources configuration of your development container.
It follows the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container). By default, `requests`, `limits` and `ephemeral-storage` are unset.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "64Mi"
    ephemeral-storage: "64Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1Gi"
    ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
```

#### remote (integer, optional)

The local port to use for SSH communication with your development environment. Defaults to a random value.

```yaml
remote: 2222
```

> Setting this value in the manifest is equivalent to starting your development container with the `okteto up --remote=2222` command.

#### reverse ([string], optional)

A list of ports to reverse forward from your development container to your local machine.
The list should follow the `remotePort:localPort` notation and each element should be unique.

```yaml
reverse:
  - 9000:9001
  - 8080:8080
```

Once your development container is up and running, any requests to `0.0.0.0:remotePort` in the development container will be directed to `localhost:localPort`

> Common uses of reverse forwarding are:
>
> 1.  Remote debugging
> 1.  Send events or logs to your local machine

If Okteto can't reverse forward a port (typically because they're already taken), the `okteto up` command will fail with an error.

#### secrets ([string], optional)

A list of secrets that will be injected into your development container.
The format of a secret is `LOCAL_PATH:REMOTE_PATH:MODE`. `LOCAL_PATH` must exist, `REMOTE_PATH` must be an absolute path, and `MODE` is the remote file permissions in Base-8 (optional: defaults to `644`).

```yaml
secrets:
  - $HOME/.token:/root/.token:400
```

#### securityContext (object, optional)

Allows you to override the pod security context of your development container.

Okteto supports overriding the `fsGroup`, `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup` and `capabilities` values.
They're not set by default, and they follow the [same syntax used in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 2000
  fsGroup: 3000
  capabilities:
    add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```

> Non-root Containers:
>
> If you're using a non-root container, and the runAsUser and runAsGroup values are not specified in your Kubernetes manifest, you need to set these values in your Okteto manifest. Remember to use the numeric ID in all cases, not the human readable name.

#### selector (map[string]string, optional)

The labels of the Kubernetes deployment/statefulset you want to put on development mode.
They must identify a single Kubernetes deployment/statefulset.

```yaml
selector:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: vote
```

#### serviceAccount (string, optional)

Allows you to override the [serviceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) of your development container.

```yaml
serviceAccount: default
```


#### services ([object], optional)

A list of services that you want to put on developer mode along your development container.
The services work just like the development container, with one exception: they won't be able to start an interactive session.

For example, imagine that you have a python-based application with an API and a Worker service. If you define the manifest as shown below, running `okteto up` would give you a remote terminal into the web development container, while synchronizing your changes with both web and worker.

```yaml
dev:
  web:
    command: ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8080"]
    sync:
      - .:/app
    services:
      - name: worker
        replicas: 2
        command: ["celery", "worker", "-A", "myproject.celeryconf", "-Q", "default", "-n", "default@%h"]
        sync:
          - .:/app
```

and both deployments, `web` and `worker` will mount your local folder `.` into the path `/app`.

The supported keys for containers defined in this section are:

1. `annotations`
1. `command`
1. `container`
1. `environment`
1. `image`
1. `labels`
1. `name`
1. `namespace`
1. `resources`
1. `sync`
1. `tolerations`
1. `workdir`
1. `replicas`

They work the same as for the main container, except for the `command` and `name` keys.
For `services`, `command` defaults to the command specified in your deployment, instead of `sh`.
`labels` and `name` are mutually exclusive (for the main container, `name` is mandatory).
`replicas` specifies the number of replicas for service dev containers.
If `replicas` is not specified, it defaults to the original deployment replicas.

#### sync ([string], required)

Specifies local folders that must be synchronized to the development container.

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
```

`sync` supports relative paths and environment variable expansion:

```yaml
sync:
  - .:/code
  - config:/etc/config
  - $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh
```

> Use the `.stignore` file on each local folder to avoid synchronizing build artifacts, dependencies, or git metadata. [More information is available here](reference/file-synchronization.mdx)

File sync can only update files that can be modified by your development container User ID.
If you are using okteto with persistent volumes, rememeber to set the field [securityContext.runAsUser](#securitycontext-object-optional) if your development container User ID is not `root`.

> You can [use secrets](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#secrets-string-optional) if you need to synchronize a single file instead of a folder

There is also an extendend `sync` notation to fine tune the file synchronization service:

```yaml
sync:
  folders:
    - .:/code
  verbose: false
  compression: true
  rescanInterval: 100
```

- `folders`: list of local folders that must be synchronized to the development container
- `verbose`: enable verbose logging for syncthing (default: `true`)
- `compression`: compress files before synchronizing them (default: `false`)
- `rescanInterval`: the synchronization service [rescan internal](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/syncing.html?highlight=rescan#scanning) in seconds. It can be set to zero to disable rescans (default: `300`)

#### timeout (time, optional)

Maximum time to be waiting for creating a development container until an error is returned.

```yaml
timeout: 5m
```

You can also use the extended notation below to specify max time to be waiting for resources.

```yaml
timeout:
  default: 3m
  resources: 5m
```

#### tolerations ([object], optional)

A list of tolerations that will be injected into your development container.

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu
    operator: Exists
```

#### volumes ([string], optional)

A list of paths in your development container that you want to associate to persistent volumes.
This is useful to persist information between `okteto up` executions, like downloaded libraries or cache information.
For example, to speed your go builds up, you could define:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /go/pkg/
  - /root/.cache/go-build/
```

You can also mount a relative subpath of your local folder:

```yaml
volumes:
  - data:/var/lib/mysql
```

#### workdir (string, optional)

Sets the working directory of your development container.

### external (object, optional)

A list of external resources that are part of your development environment.  Use this section for resources that are deployed outside of the okteto cluster, like Cloud resources or dashboards.

```yaml
external:
  db:
    notes: docs/database.md
    icon: database
    endpoints:
    - name: db
      url: https://localhost:3306
  functions:
    notes: docs/lambdas.md
    icon: function
    endpoints:
    - name: data-aggregator
      url: https://fake-id.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws.aggregator
    - name: data-processor
      url: https://fake-id.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws.processor
```

#### endpoints ([object], required)

Endpoints contain information on how to access the external resource.

##### name (string, required)

The name of the endpoint. 

##### url (string, optional)

The url of the endpoint.

##### Use dynamic endpoints for an external URL

The url value related to an external resource can be set during deployment stage by sharing `$OKTETO_EXTERNAL_{EXTERNAL_NAME}_ENDPOINTS_{ENDPOINT_NAME}_URL`. This allows a value to be generated dynamically at deployment time.

```yaml
deploy:
  - name: Set endpoint URL dynamically
    command: echo "OKTETO_EXTERNAL_DB_ENDPOINTS_DB_URL=$(aws deploy db --name foo)" >> $OKTETO_ENV
  - name: Use dynamic value
    command: echo ${OKTETO_EXTERNAL_DB_ENDPOINTS_DB_URL}
external:
  db:
    notes: docs/database.md
    icon: database
    endpoints:
    - name: db
    # url: is not set because it is dynamically generated in the deploy section.
```

If the url value is declared in both places, the one declared in the deploy section will prevail. 

#### icon (string, optional)

 Sets the icon that will be shown in the Okteto UI. The supported values for icons are listed below. If empty, it will default to `default`.

 - `container`
 - `dashboard`
 - `database`
 - `default`
 - `function`
 - `graph`
 - `storage`
 - `launchdarkly`
 - `mongodb`
 - `gcp`
 - `aws`
 - `okteto`

#### notes (string, optional)

A relative path to a markdown file. The contents of the file will be displayed in the Okteto UI. You can use this to describe the resource or share instructions on how to use it.

[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is supported, which adds the following to standard [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/):
- Autolink literals (`www.x.com`)
- Footnotes (`[^1]`)
- Strikethrough (`~~stuff~~`)
- Tables (`| cell |…`)
- Tasklists (`* [x]`)

Images are allowed, as long as they are referenced by `https://`. Images from unsupported protocol sources or relative paths will not render and will be replaced with a warning message pointing to this document.

Inline HTML markup will be escaped and render as text.

### forward ([string], optional)

When declaring a global forward, Okteto will automatically handle port collision when two or more `okteto up` sessions are running simultaneously. If the `okteto up` session detects that the port is already in use, and said port is defined as global forward,  `okteto up` will ignore the port collision and continue the `up` sequence. If the port is later available, `okteto up` session will automatically connect to it without interrupting the session.

Global forward uses the same format than [forward](#forward-string-optional):

```yaml
forward:
  - 5432:postgres:5432
  - localPort: 8080
    remotePort: 80
    name: app
```

You can also indicate the service to expose using a label selector.

```yaml
forward:
  - localPort: 5432
    remotePort: 5432
    labels:
      app: db
```

### icon (string, optional)

The icon associated to your development environmen in the Okteto UI (optional).

### name (string, optional)

The name of your development environment. It defaults to the name of your git repository.

### namespace (string, optional)

The namespace where the development environment is deployed. By default, it takes the current okteto context namespace.

You can use an environment variable to replace the namespace field, or any part of it:

```yaml
namespace: $DEV_NAMESPACE
```

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of the Okteto Manifest that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Substitute environment variables

It’s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside an okteto manifest:

```yaml
image: "node:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in the okteto manifest in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the okteto manifest.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat okteto.yaml
...
    image: "node:${TAG}"
...
```

When you run any Okteto CLI command, `image` will be `node:v1.5`.

> Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.
