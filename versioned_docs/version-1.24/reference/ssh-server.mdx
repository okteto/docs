As part of enabling your development container, `okteto up` performs the following steps:

- A [minimalist SSH server](https://github.com/okteto/remote) is injected into your development container
- A port forward is created from a local port to port 22 of the development container
- A host entry is added to your local `.ssh/config` file with the following values:

```
Host MANIFEST_NAME.okteto
  HostName localhost
  Port PORT
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

> Use the [remote](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#remote-integer-optional) field to configure the local port where the SSH server is exposed.

The SSH server is used by `okteto up` to run remote commands and forward ports from/to your development containers.
The SSH server makes it possible to integrate your development container with IDEs that support remote development, such as [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=okteto.remote-kubernetes), [PHPStorm](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=57294700) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-debugging-with-product.html).

### Connect using SSH

Once the development container is up and running, you can SSH into it with the following command:

```console
$ ssh -P PORT localhost
```

You can also SSH using the host entry added to your local SSH config:

```console
$ ssh MANIFEST_NAME.okteto
```

### Secure by default

When you run `okteto up` the first time, Okteto will create a SSH key pair for you and save it at `$HOME/.okteto/id_rsa_okteto` and `$HOME/.okteto/id_rsa_okteto.pub`.
The SSH server launched in your development container will be automatically configured to use these keys for authentication.
