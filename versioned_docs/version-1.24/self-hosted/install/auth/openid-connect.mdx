This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the authentication provider for Okteto.

:::note
If you are looking to configure Private Registry credentials from Amazon ECR, please [see our guide here](admin/registry-credentials/amazon-ecr.mdx#using-openid-connect-oidc-federation).
:::

Okteto supports any identity provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard. We have dedicated guides for the following providers:

- [Azure Active Directory](azure-ad.mdx)
- [GitLab](gitlab.mdx)
- [Okta](okta.mdx)

For other providers, follow your OpenID Connect service provider's documentation on how to create the required application.

:::note
Your provider needs to support the [UserInfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) in order to be used with Okteto.
This authentication option follows the OpenID standard, and it has been validated with Okta, PingIdentity, and GitLab.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A working installation of [Okteto](get-started/install/index.mdx)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0+ installed in your local machine

## Create the OpenID Connect Application

When creating the application, you'll need to provide the following values:

- Start SSO URL: `https://okteto.DOMAIN`
- Redirect URIs: `https://okteto.DOMAIN`, `https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback`
- Scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`
- Response Type: `code`
- Grant Type: `authorization code`

## Configure Okteto

Once you have the  OpenID Connect Application ready, update the `auth` section of your Helm configuration file with the following values:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
  openid:
    enabled: true
    // highlight-next-line
    clientId: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID"
    // highlight-next-line
    clientSecret: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET"
    // highlight-next-line
    group: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_GROUP"
    endpoints:
      // highlight-next-line
      issuer: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_ISSUER_URL"
      // highlight-next-line
      authorization: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_URL"
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
      groupsKey: groups
```

> You can also use a [secret](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#store-sensitive-configuration-values-using-a-secret) to store the sensitive part of these credentials.

[Upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.

The `group` field is optional. Only members of the group will be allowed to log in into your Okteto instance. An empty `group` field permits any user to log in.

The `issuer` and `authorization` endpoints must match the value returned in the provider config discovery.

The `mapping` fields are optional. Use them to configure the mapping between Okteto's user attributes and the claim coming from your authentication provider.
