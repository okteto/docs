title: Development Environments
description: In this section, we'll see how you can use Development Environments on Okteto
---

Development Environments enable developers to develop applications on Kubernetes with a joyful development experience.
Developers write code locally on their machine with the tools they love, and Okteto transparently updates their application on Kubernetes **in real-time as they code**!

Developers don't have to spend time configuring and deploying their applications.
Everything is pre-configured in the [Okteto Manifest](core/okteto-manifest.mdx).
This way developers spend less time troubleshooting your development environment and more time coding cool features for their users ðŸ˜Ž

In this section you will learn about:

- Using the [Okteto CLI](development/using-okteto-cli.mdx)
- Configure [Development Containers](development/containers/index.mdx) to hot reload and debug your application on Okteto
- Customize your [development images](development/images.mdx) for a better developer experience
- Learn more about different ways to [deploy](development/deploy/index.mdx) your Development Environments
