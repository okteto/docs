# Welcome to Okteto Test `BETA`

Okteto Test is a new `Beta` feature designed to seamlessly integrate testing into your development workflow on the Okteto platform. Whether you're running unit tests or end-to-end (E2E) tests, Okteto Test ensures an efficient testing experience before even making a pull request.

## Benefits of Okteto Test

### 1. Seamless Integration and Remote Execution
Developers can execute tests in the same remote production-like Kubernetes environment where their code runs - without having to install anything locally.
Running your tests in the cluster network simplifies access to private services, reduces latency, ensures consistency and reduces configuration overhead.

### 2. Simplified Configuration
The new `test` section in the [Okteto manifest](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#test-object-optional) supports multiple Test Containers, allowing you to define your test environment with minimal YAML configuration.
This eliminates the need for complex setups and advanced Kubernetes knowledge.

### 3. Faster Feedback Loop
Okteto Test leverages Buildkit's built-in capabilities to run only the tests affected by code changes.
You can quickly identify and fix issues, especially in monorepos, significantly reducing the feedback loop for a development cycle.
