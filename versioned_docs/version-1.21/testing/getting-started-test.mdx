This guide explains how to configure Test Containers for your first app in Okteto.

## Requirements

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you fulfill the following requirements:

- You have access to an Okteto instance. Otherwise, follow our [installation guide](get-started/install/index.mdx)
- You have [configured the Okteto CLI](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) with your Okteto instance
- You have completed [our guide to deploy your first app to Okteto](get-started/deploy-your-app/index.mdx)

## What you will be building

This tutorial will guide you on how to test our sample [Movies app](https://github.com/okteto/getting-started) using Okteto.

## Step 1: Deploy the Movies App

Get a local version of the Movies Sample App by executing the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okteto/getting-started
cd getting-started
```

Switch to the `onboarded` branch:

```bash
git checkout onboarded
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yaml` file.
This file describes how to build, deploy and test the Movies app.

Deploy your development environment by executing:

```bash
okteto deploy
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Jun  4 15:37:11 2024
NAMESPACE: pchico83
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
 ‚úì  Development environment 'getting-started' successfully deployed
 ```

## Step 2: Execute the `frontend` unit tests in a Test Container

The [test](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#test-object-optional) section in the Okteto Manifest defines how to test the Movies app.

For example, add the Test Container to run unit tests for the `frontend` service like this:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
test:
  frontend:
    image: node:20
    context: frontend
    caches:
      - yarn/.cache
      - node_modules
    commands:
      - yarn install
      - yarn test
```

`frontend` is the name of the Test Container. The meaning of the rest of the fields are:

- `image`: the image used as the runtime of your Test Container.
- `context`: the folder that will be synchronized between your local machine and the Test Container.
- `caches`: a list of folders to persist between executions of the Test Container. This is very important for the performance of your Test Containers.
- `commands`: a list of commands to execute your tests.

Also, note that there is an `.oktetoignore` file in the `frontend` folder to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your Test Container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, cache metadata, or dependencies like the `node_modules` folder.

Next, execute the following command to run the `frontend` unit tests in a Test Container:

```bash
okteto test frontend
```

The first execution takes longer because `caches` aren't initialized yet, but you will get this output:

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Executing test container 'frontend'
 i  Running 'yarn install'
yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
Done in 43.31s.
 ‚úì  Command 'yarn install' successfully executed
 i  Running 'yarn test'
yarn run v1.22.22
$ jest
PASS src/components/Hero.test.jsx
PASS src/components/TitleList.test.jsx
PASS src/components/Item.test.jsx
PASS src/components/App.test.jsx
PASS src/components/UserProfile.test.jsx
PASS src/components/ListToggle.test.jsx
Test Suites: 6 passed, 6 total
Tests:       20 passed, 20 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.658 s
Ran all test suites.
Done in 6.59s.
 ‚úì  Command 'yarn test' successfully executed
 ‚úì  Test container 'frontend' passed
```

If you rerun your Test Container:

```bash
okteto test frontend
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Executing test container 'frontend'
 i  Skipping test container 'frontend', CACHED
 ‚úì  Test container 'frontend' passed
```

You can see that Okteto skips the execution of the tests. This is because the content of the folder `context: frontend` didn't change.
This is very convenient in monorepos, since Okteto won't rerun unit tests if the folder has no changes.

:::note
You can skip this behavior with the `--no-cache` flag of the `okteto test` command

## Step 3: Execute the `api` unit tests in a Test Container

The Test Container to run unit tests for the `api` service looks like this:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
test:
  api:
    image: node:20
    context: api
    caches:
      - yarn/.cache
      - node_modules
    commands:
      - yarn install
      - yarn test
```

Execute the following command to run the `api` unit tests in a Test Container:

```bash
okteto test api
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Executing test container 'api'
 i  Running 'yarn install'
yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
Done in 9.01s.
 ‚úì  Command 'yarn install' successfully executed
 i  Running 'yarn test'
yarn run v1.22.22
$ jest
PASS ./load.test.js
  ‚óè Console
    console.log
      all loaded
      at log (load.js:44:13)
PASS ./server.test.js
  ‚óè Console
    console.log
      Server running on port 8080.
      at log (server.js:52:13)
    console.log
      GET /api/movies
      at log (server.js:29:15)
    console.log
      GET /api/watching
      at log (server.js:41:15)
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       7 passed, 7 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.098 s
Ran all test suites.
Done in 1.79s.
 ‚úì  Command 'yarn test' successfully executed
 ‚úì  Test container 'api' passed
```


## Step 3: Execute the `e2e` integration tests in a Test Container

The Test Container to run integration tests looks like this:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
test:
  e2e:
    image: okteto/playwright:chromium
    context: e2e
    caches:
      - yarn/.cache
      - node_modules
    commands:
      - bash run_tests.sh
    artifacts:
      - test-results
      - playwright-report
```

`e2e` is the name of the Test Container. The meaning of the rest of fields is:

- `image`: the image used as the runtime of your Test Container.
- `context`: the folder that will be synchronized between your local machine and the Test Container.
- `caches`: a list of folders to persist between executions of the Test Container. This is very important for the performance of your Test Containers.
- `commands`: a list of commands to execute your tests.
- `artifacts`: a list of files/folders to export to your local filesystem after the remote execution of the tests.

Execute the following command to run your integration tests in a Test Container:

```bash
okteto test e2e
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Executing test container 'e2e'
 i  Running 'bash run_tests.sh'
yarn install v1.22.19
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
Done in 4.53s.
yarn run v1.22.19
$ playwright test
Running 6 tests using 2 workers
  ‚úì  1 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ content.spec.js:26:5 ‚Ä∫ displays the movies section (3.2s)
  ‚úì  2 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ content.spec.js:48:5 ‚Ä∫ displays the watching section (3.2s)
  ‚úì  3 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ header.spec.js:3:5 ‚Ä∫ displays the header (762ms)
  ‚úì  4 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ hero.spec.js:3:5 ‚Ä∫ displays the hero (936ms)
  ‚úì  5 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ main.spec.js:3:5 ‚Ä∫ has title (1.6s)
  ‚úì  6 [chromium] ‚Ä∫ main.spec.js:10:5 ‚Ä∫ matches screenshot (3.6s)
  6 passed (9.9s)
To open last HTML report run:
  yarn playwright show-report
Done in 10.88s.
 ‚úì  Command 'bash run_tests.sh' successfully executed
 ‚úì  Test container 'e2e' passed
```

The `e2e` test container uses `playwright` to fetch the list of movies and compare the results with the list of Movies in the MongoDB database.
The `BASE_URL` of the integration tests is built using the environment variables `OKTETO_NAMESPACE` and `OKTETO_DOMAIN`.
This code shows you how to [form the BASE_URL of your integration tests](https://github.com/okteto/getting-started/blob/main/e2e/playwright.config.js#L3).
Note that your test scripts run in the `okteto` namespace, if you need to access private service like `mongodb`, you need to do it via the hostname `mongodb.${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}`.
This code shows you how to [access private services from your integration tests](https://github.com/okteto/getting-started/blob/main/e2e/data/getStoredData.js#L5).


## Next Steps

Congratulations, you just tested **your first application in Okteto** üöÄ.

Okteto lets you test your applications directly on Kubernetes. This way you can:

- Make sure your tests run the same way in your inner development loop and [Okteto Preview Environments](previews/index.mdx)
- Run your tests directly in Kubernetes, to simplify access to your application and reduce latency
