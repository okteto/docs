Okteto is a platform that simplifies the process of launching cloud development environments without requiring the expertise to do this yourself. This enables developers to automatically spin up fully-managed development environments that emulate production as closely as possible. Okteto eliminates the friction of local development environments, the many deviations that can exist for the same engineering organization, and the troubleshooting that comes with them.

This tutorial will show you how to develop and debug a Node.js application using Okteto.

## Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the Okteto CLI and configure it to access Okteto. [Follow our getting started guide](get-started/install-okteto-cli.mdx) if you haven't done it yet.

## Step 1: Deploy the Node.js Sample App

Get a local version of the Node.js Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/node-getting-started
$ cd node-getting-started
```

At the root of the directory, you'll find the `okteto.yaml` file. This describes how to [build](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#build-object-optional) and [deploy](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#deploy-string-optional) the Node Sample App.

```
build:
  hello-world:
    image: okteto.dev/node-hello-world:1.0.0
    context: .
deploy:
  - kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

Deploy your development environment by executing:

```console
$ okteto deploy --build
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Building image for service 'hello-world'
 i  Building the image 'okteto.dev/node-hello-world:1.0.0' in tcp://buildkit.okteto.example.com:1234...
[+] Building 5.9s (11/11) FINISHED
 ...
 âœ“  Image 'registry.okteto.example.com/cindy/node-hello-world:1.0.0' successfully pushed
 i  Running kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
deployment.apps/hello-world created
service/hello-world created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/hello-world created
 âœ“  Development environment 'node-getting-started' successfully deployed
 i  Run 'okteto up' to activate your development container
```

Log into your Okteto instance and click on the URL of the application:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/okteto-ui.png").default}
  alt="Okteto UI Node.js"
  width="850"
/>

Did you notice that you're accessing your application through an HTTPs endpoint? This is because Okteto will [automatically create them](core/ingress/automatic-ssl.mdx) for you when you deploy your application. Cool no ðŸ˜Ž?

## Step 2: Activate your development container

The [dev](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a development container for the Node Sample App:

```
dev:
  hello-world:
    command: bash
    sync:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    forward:
      - 9229:9229
```

The `hello-world` key matches the name of the hello world Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:

- `command`: the start command of the development container.
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the development container.
- `forward`: a list of ports to forward from your development container to localhost in your machine. This is needed to configure the Node debugger.

Also, note that there is a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your development container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, git metadata, or dependencies like the `node_modules` folder.

Next, execute the following command to activate your development container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 âœ“  Persistent volume successfully attached
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world
    Forward:   9229 -> 9229


Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your development container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application in hot-reload mode by running the following command:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> npm run start
```

```console
> node-getting-started@1.0.0 start /usr/src/app
> nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.18
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Starting hello-world server...
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page to test that your application is running.

## Step 3: Remote Development with Okteto

Open the `index.js` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 5 to be _Hello world from the cluster!_. Save your changes.

```javascript
res.send("Hello world from the cluster!");
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your development container.
Take a look at the development container shell and notice how the changes are detected by `nodemon` and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Starting hello-world server...
```

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required ðŸ˜Ž!

## Step 4: Remote debugging with Okteto

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE.
Let's take a look at how that works in VS Code, one of the most popular IDEs for Node development.
If you haven't done it yet, install the Node.js extension available from Visual Studio marketplace.

Cancel the execution of `nodemon index.js` from the development container shell by pressing `ctrl + c`.
Rerun your application in debug mode:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> npm run debug
```

```console
Debugger listening on ws://0.0.0.0:9229/73d8d793-b0c3-4310-86ee-3a42938a5df1
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
```

Open the _Debug_ extension and run the _Connect to okteto_ debug configuration (or press the F5 shortcut):

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Connect to okteto",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "address": "localhost",
      "port": 9229,
      "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

> You should be replacing the value of `remoteRoot` with wherever your application code is.

Add a breakpoint on `index.js`, line 5. Go back to the browser and reload the page.
The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc...

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/node-halt.png").default}
  alt="breakpoint in Node.js"
  width="850"
/>

Your code is running in Okteto, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools.
Pretty cool no? ðŸ˜‰
