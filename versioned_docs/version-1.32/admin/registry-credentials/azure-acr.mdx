This tutorial will guide you on how to use your private Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Okteto.
It's recommended that you have the [Azure CLI installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) to follow this tutorial.

The steps to configure your private ACR with Okteto are: 

- Create a user with access to your private ACR
- Retrieve the user credentials
- Configure the credentials in Okteto

## Step 1: Create a user with access to your private ACR

First you need to create a `Service Principal` with `role based access control`.

To do so, you will need the following information: 

- `scopes`: the ID of your Azure Container Registry
- `role`: `PULL` to have read access to your private ACR

You can list your current container registries with:

```bash
az acr list
```

Pick the name of your ACR and export it to an environment variable:

```bash
export ACR_NAME=<<your-acr-name>>
```

Get the ID of your ACR with the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az-acr-show) by executing:

```bash
ACR_REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query "id" --output tsv)
```

Create the ServicePrincipal with PULL access with the [AzureCLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-2#create-a-service-principal-containing-a-password) by executing:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --scopes $ACR_REGISTRY_ID --role acrpull
```

## Step 2: Retrieve the user credentials

Get the `APP ID` by executing the following command:

```bash
APP_ID=$(az ad sp list --display-name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --query "[].appId" --output tsv)
```

Create a `PASSWORD` for that `APP ID`: 

```bash
az ad sp credential reset --id $APP_ID
```

```bash
{
  "appId": "<<your-app-id>>",
  "password": "<<your-password>>",
  "tenant": "98e0e81b-dd65-4132-9d6c-ed2ac3e14e28"
}
```

Remember the value of `appId` and `password`. You will need them in the next step.

## Step 3: Configure the credentials in Okteto

Add the following registry credentials to the [Admin Registry Credentials view](index.mdx#add-registry-credentials) in the Okteto Admin Dashboard:

Start by navigating to **Admin -> Registry Credentials** under the Integrations section.

Click "Add Credential" and use the following settings:
- **Type**: `Static`
- **Hostname**: your Azure Container Registry name (`ACR_NAME`)
- **Username**: `appId` from the previous step
- **Password**: `password` from the previous step
