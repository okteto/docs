In this section, we'll learn different ways to deploy your Development Environment in Okteto.

You can use the Okteto CLI [deploy](reference/okteto-cli.mdx#deploy) command to deploy your Development Environment from your local machine.

But you can also deploy your Development Environment using these methods:

- [From the Catalog](development/deploy/deploy-from-catalog.mdx)
- [From Git Repositories](development/deploy/deploy-from-git.mdx)
- [From the GitHub integration](development/deploy/from-private-repositories.mdx)
- [Develop on Okteto button](development/deploy/develop-on-okteto-button.mdx)
