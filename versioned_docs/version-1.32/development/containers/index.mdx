description: In this section, we'll see how you can use Development Containers on Okteto
---

Okteto makes it easier to develop on Kubernetes by using Development Containers.
Development Containers allow you to hot reload and debug your Development Environments **as fast as you write code** ðŸš€

Development Containers support two different modes:

- [File Sync development mode](file-sync/index.mdx): syncs your local changes to your remote Development Container (default mode)
- [Hybrid development mode](hybrid/index.mdx): runs your service locally and simulates your laptop belonging to the cluster network by using ssh tunnels

The [mode](reference/okteto-manifest.mdx#mode-string-optional) is configured in your Okteto Manifest and affects the behavior of [`okteto up`](reference/okteto-cli.mdx#up).
