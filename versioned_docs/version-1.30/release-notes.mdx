- `cue`, `helmfile`, `kustomize`, `yq` and `docker-credential-ecr-login` binaries were removed from the Okteto's default pipeline runner image. If you need some of those binaries in your pipelines, you can build [your own runner image](admin/custom-installer-image.mdx).

### New Features

- We now allow the ability for admins of Okteto to [set the minimum accepted CLI version for their team](admin/dashboard.mdx#command-line-cli). This will apply for all users who are using CLI 3.2.0 and above <!-- 8829 -->

- For [Catalog](admin/catalog.mdx) and [Cloud Credentials](admin/cloud-credentials/index.mdx) items that were created via CRDs, we've added "read-only" tags in the Dashboard to avoid confusion on which items can be edited in the UI <!-- 8886 -->
- Updated buildkit cacheRatio default value to `0.5`  <!-- 8921 -->
- The Okteto installer image is no longer needed, binaries for the installer jobs are now installed from `okteto/backend` <!-- 8767 -->
- [Okteto CLI 3.2.1](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1): We merged `okteto/bin` and `okteto/busybox` images into the `okteto/okteto` image to reduce the number of images used in the CLI workflow
- [Okteto CLI 3.2.1](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.2.1): You can now define the Admin Variable `OKTETO_DEV_PERSISTENT_VOLUME_SIZE` to configure the default volume size for Development Containers

## 1.26.0

9 November 2024

This version is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.27 to 1.30

### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-1.26}
Please read the following changes before upgrading to 1.26

- **ACTION REQUIRED: Hostname Length Limit**\
Deployments now fail if a service hostname exceeds 63 characters, and an error message is shown. This limit is automatically applied to all resources. Previously, dev environments could deploy successfully even if endpoints didn‚Äôt work. This change may affect environments that deployed without issues before.
- **Helm Release Name Limit**:\
Helm release names are now limited to 63 characters. While this limit is automatically enforced for most resources, the `DefaultBackend` service can still fail during installation if its name exceeds this limit. \
To avoid installation errors, use the `defaultBackend.nameOverride` setting to shorten the `DefaultBackend` service name. If you need to rename the `DefaultBackend` during an upgrade,[follow this guide as it may impact the installation](https://www.okteto.com/docs/1.26/self-hosted/helm-configuration/#manual-migration-steps-when-renaming-the-defaultbackend-service).
- **Private Repository Deploys**: Deploying private repositories now uses the Okteto backend as the SSH agent, rather than mounting the local SSH agent. This change ensures feature parity between remote and local deploys but may impact scenarios where private repositories are cloned as part of commands defined in the deploy section during remote execution
- **Buildkit Persistence Enabled**: Buildkit persistence is now enabled by default, with a 100Gi disk and cache set to 90% of the disk size. If you previously used `buildkit.persistence.cache`, adjust to the new ratio, as this setting is no longer applicable

### New Features

- **[Introducing the Okteto Resource Manager](admin/resource-manager.mdx)**: a new feature that automatically optimizes CPU and memory requests for your environments. By analyzing real-time resource utilization, the Resource Manager dynamically adjusts resource requests to ensure efficient usage, prevent node overload, and improve overall cluster performance. This feature simplifies resource management, reduces manual adjustments, and enhances application stability, especially in larger clusters. The default installation provides recommendations but doesn't apply them automatically. [See our docs for details on how to apply these automatically](admin/resource-manager.mdx)
- Added Okteto [Garbage Collector settings to the Admin Dashboard](admin/cleanup.mdx): Admins can now manage sleep and delete periods from the Dashboard, with the ability to set different configurations for Namespaces and Preview Environments
- [Remote Execution can now be set as the default](core/remote-execution.mdx) in the Okteto Admin Dashboard, allowing admins to enforce consistent remote deploys. Remote deploys also include improvements for feature parity with local deploys, such as the ability to specify the context synchronization folder and private Git repository cloning during deploy commands using SSH keys
- Added additional feature and documentation for [running Buildkit at scale](self-hosted/manage/buildkit-high-performance.mdx)  <!-- 8727 -->

### Improvements

- Okteto will now automatically create a Docker secret if one doesn't already exist in the Controller Manager. This prevents a misleading warning that was being displayed in some scenarios when deploying from the UI  <!-- 8566 -->
- [Buildkit cache size is now automatically configured](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#buildkit) based on its PVC volume size  <!-- 8723 -->
- Removed Buildkit persistency as an installation step now that it defaults to true  <!-- 8771 -->
- The Okteto frontend now runs rootless by default, while Buildkit operates without privileges when rootless mode is enabled  <!-- 8774, 8800 -->
- We've [released Okteto CLI 3.1.0 with many new improvements](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0)
- [Okteto CLI 3.1.0](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0): Added support for a `context` field in the Okteto Manifest, allowing you to specify the working directory for commands in the `deploy` and `destroy` sections
- [Okteto CLI 3.1.0](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/3.1.0): [Added automatic retry for build operations](reference/feature-flags.mdx) when BuildKit is unavailable due to transient errors. The behavior can be controlled using the environment variables `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_MAX_RETRIES_FOR_TRANSIENT_ERRORS`, `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, and `OKTETO_BUILDKIT_RETRY_INTERVAL`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that was preventing Development Environments to be destroyed when the specified manifest doesn't exist  <!-- 8760 -->
- Fixed a patch operation in the Okteto Insights cronjob that was causing the loss of node labels when there were concurrent operations from external processes  <!-- 8782 -->
- Resolved an issue where build logs were not displayed in the UI when deploying dev or preview environments, causing the UI to appear frozen. Build logs now display correctly during deployments


## 1.25.0

- Removed the automatic binding between `cluster-admin` cluster role, and every service account created within a namespace managed by Okteto. You can find more information in our [Upgrade Guide here](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx#upgrading-to-okteto-122x).  <!-- 8245 -->

### New Features


- Support of AWS IAM Roles to configure Private Registries. Please see [the specific documentation page](admin/registry-credentials/amazon-ecr.mdx) to understand their configuration   <!-- 8104 -->
- Add OIDC endpoint to the cluster overview panel in the Admin Dashboard  <!-- 8151 -->

- Admin users are now able to perform any operation on any user's namespace via UI, CLI or at the Kubernetes level
- Added configuration for developer permissions in global preview environments via role binding to the cluster role set by [`serviceAccounts.roleBindings.previews`](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#serviceaccounts) Helm setting
- Developers now have read access to global preview environments at the Kubernetes level (after getting Kubernetes context with `okteto kubeconfig`)
- Changed Admin Users' role selection label from "User" to "Developer" for consistency  <!-- 8202 -->
- Improved Okteto Insights data collection time  <!-- 8222 -->
- Reorganized 'user' helm setting to 'serviceAccounts' and include one setting to create a role binding for global previews. Please see our [upgrade guide](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx#upgrading-to-okteto-122x) for details on how to adopt the changes  <!-- 8233 -->
- Specified the credentials to be removed in the delete credential confirmation dialog  <!-- 8250 -->
- Upgraded the Okteto CLI version to [2.29.0](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.29.0)
- Okteto CLI: Admins can now perform operations in any user's namespaces via the CLI context
- Okteto CLI: Test artifacts defined under the `test` section are exported even if tests execution fails
- Okteto CLI: Images defined in your Okteto manifest targeting dev registry (okteto.dev) and using a custom tag will now benefit from [Okteto Smart Builds](core/build-service.mdx#smart-builds)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a rare issue where the Okteto Dashboard would render nothing during loading  <!-- 8199 -->
- Fixed an issue in the webhook that was preventing a Virtual Service to keep the specified `exportTo` field  <!-- 8204 -->
