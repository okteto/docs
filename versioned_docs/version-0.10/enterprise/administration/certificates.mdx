## Bring your own Wildcard Certificate

By default, Okteto Enterprise will create a wildcard certificate for your cluster using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This certificate is used to secure communication to the Okteto dashboard, the build service, the registry service, and to all the applications that use  [Automatic SSL Endpoints](/docs/cloud/ssl/).

In certain scenarios you may want to bring your own certificates rather than let Okteto create a wildcard certificate for you. You can configure this via the `wildcardCertificate` configuration key in your Helm configuration file.

To start, you need the private and public keys of your certificate. The certificate must be a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate, with `*.SUBDOMAIN` as its `Subject Alternative Name`.

Import the secret into your kubernetes cluster by running the command below:

```
kubectl create secret tls ${CERT_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE} --namespace okteto
```

After you create the secret, add the following to your Helm configuration file to tell Okteto and NGINX to use your certificate.

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: your-ssl-certificate-secret

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/your-ssl-certificate-secret
```

Finally, [install or upgrade](/docs/0.10/enterprise/install/deployment/) your Okteto Enterprise installation for the new configuration to be applied.

## Bring your own Certificate Authority

By default, Okteto will trust a certificate issued by any well-know certificate authority. If your certificate is self-signed, issued by a new certificate authority, or issued by a private certificate authority, you'll need to import your certificate authority's public key.

First import your certificate authority by running the command below:

```
kubectl create secret generic ${CA_NAME} --from-file=ca.crt=${CA_FILE} --namespace okteto
```

After you create the secret, add the following to your Helm configuration file to tell Okteto to use your certificate authority.

```
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: your-ssl-certificate-secret
  privateCA:
    enabled: true
    secret:
      name: your-ca-secret
      key: ca.crt

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/your-ssl-certificate-secret
```

Finally, [install or upgrade](/docs/0.10/enterprise/install/deployment/) your Okteto Enterprise installation for the new configuration to be applied.
