Okteto Stacks are for developers who don't want to deal with the complexities of Kubernetes manifests.
Okteto Stacks implement and extend the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) to make it easy to deploy containers in Kubernetes.

## Example

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

volumes:
  redis:
```

The equivalent Kubernetes manifests would have more than 300 lines of yaml!

## Schema reference

### services ([object], optional)

Define the services that make up your Okteto Stack.

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data
```

Each service supports the fields in the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).
We summarize the most relevant ones below:

#### build ([string|object], optional)

Indicate how to build the image of this service when running `okteto stack deploy --build`. The value is the path to the build context:

```yaml
build: vote
```

It can also be an object with these fields:

- `context`: the build context. When the value supplied is a relative path, it is interpreted as relative to the location of the Okteto Stack manifest file (default: `.`)
- `dockerfile`: the path to the Dockerfile. It is a relative path to the build context (default: `Dockerfile`)
- `target`: build the specified stage as defined inside the Dockerfile. See the multi-stage build [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) for details.
- `args`: add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process. Build arguments with a value containing a `$` sign are resolved to the environment variable value on the machine okteto is running on, which can be helpful for secret or machine-specific values.

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
  target: prod
  args:
    - ENV1=prod
    - ENV2=$VALUE
```

`okteto stack deploy --build` builds a new docker image, pushes it to the registry and redeploys your containers. By default, it builds the images using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/0.10/cloud/build/). Set the variable `BUILDKIT_HOST` if you want to use your own BuildKit instance.

#### cap_add ([string], optional)

Add container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_add:
  - ALL
```

#### cap_drop ([string], optional)

Drop container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yaml
cap_drop:
  - NET_ADMIN
  - SYS_ADMIN
```

#### command (string, optional)

Override the default command of the container image `CMD`.

```yaml
command: --debug
```

`command` can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
command: ["-p", "3000"]
```

#### depends_on ([string]|object, optional)

Specify the conditions that the declared services must meet in order for the service to start. The condition must be one of the following:

- `service_started`: Wait until the service is running.
- `service_healthy`: Wait for one of the ports of the dependent service to be available.
- `service_completed_successfully`: Wait until the dependent service has been successfully completed.


```yaml
depends_on:
  app:
    condition: service_started
  db:
    condition: service_healthy
  initialization-svc:
    condition: service_completed_successfully
```

You can also express dependencies as a list of services. In this case it will be the same as setting the condition to `service_started`.

```yaml
depends_on:
  - app
  - db
  - initialization-svc
```

#### entrypoint (string, optional)

Override the default entrypoint of the container image `ENTRYPOINT`.

```yaml
entrypoint: yarn start
```

The entrypoint can also be a list of strings:

```yaml
entrypoint: ["yarn", "start"]
```

#### env_file (string, optional)

Add environment variables from a file to the containers of a service.
Environment variables declared in the [environment section](/docs/0.10/reference/stacks/#environment-string-optional) override these values. This also holds true if those values are empty or undefined.

```yaml
env_file: .env
```

`env_file` also accepts a list of files:

```yaml
env_file:
  - .env.frontend
  - .env.api
```

#### environment ([string], optional)

Add environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  DEV_MODE: yes
  DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
```

#### image (string, optional)

The container image of each service.

```yaml
image: okteto/vote:stacks
```

If [`build`](/docs/reference/stacks/#build-stringobject-optional) is defined, `image` is optional. Otherwise, it's required.

#### labels ([string], optional)

Specify labels for the service. They translates to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: sample
```

#### ports ([int], optional)

Ports exposed by each service. By default, they're only accessible from the cluster private network.

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080
```

To make the port public, use the following notation:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
```

In you need need to configure HTTPS routes, use [endpoints](/docs/0.10/reference/stacks/#endpoints-object-optional) instead of configuring an NGINX container in your Docker Compose file.

The following ports are never made public:

| Protocol  | Port  |
|---|---|
| MySQL  | 3306 |
| OracleDB  | 1521,1830 |
| PostgreSQL   | 5432 |
| SQL Server   | 1433,1434 |
| MaxDB  | 7210  |
| Neo4j  |  7473 |
| ArangoDB  |  8529  |
| Cassandra  | 7000,7001,9042  |
| InfluxDB |  8086 |
| Elasticsearch | 9200,9300 |
| CouchDB  | 5984 |
| MongoDB | 27017,27018,27019,28017 |
| Redis |  6379 |
| Riak | 8087,8088 |
| RethinkDB | 828015,29015,28015 |
| Solr | 7574,8983 |
| Golang debugger | 2345  |
| Node debugger | 5858,9229 |
| Java debugger | 5005 |
| Ruby debugger | 1234 |
| Python debugger | 4444,5678 |

In you need make these ports public, you can use [endpoints](/docs/0.10/reference/stacks/#endpoints-object-optional).

#### scale (int, optional)

Specify the number of containers running for each service (default: `1`).

```yaml
scale: 2
```

#### resources (object, optional)

Configure resource [requests and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      cpu: 300m
      memory: 500Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 800Mi
```

`reservations` translates to Kubernetes `requests`.

#### restart (string, optional)
Defines the policy that the platform will apply on container termination.

 - `always/unless-stopped/any`: The default restart policy. The policy always restarts the container until its removal.
 - `none/never/no`:  The policy does not restart a container under any circumstances.
 - `on-failure`: The policy restarts a container if the exit code indicates an error.

```yaml
deploy:
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    max_attempts: 3
```

If the restart policy is other than always, the service will be translated to a Kubernetes Job.

#### stop_grace_period (duration|int, optional)

Specify how long to wait when attempting to stop a container before sending SIGKILL. If no unit of time is given, the system will interpret the number in seconds.

```yaml
stop_grace_period: 10s
```


#### volumes ([string], optional)

Define volumes accessible by the containers of a service at a given path.

```yaml
volumes:
  - redis:/data
```

The volume `redis` must be defined in the [volumes section](/docs/0.10/reference/stacks/#volumes-object-optional).

The following notation is also accepted:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /data
```

#### working_dir (string, optional)

Override the default working directory of the container image `WORKDIR`.

```yaml
working_dir: "/app/code"
```

### volumes ([object], optional)

List of volumes created by the Okteto Stack.
Volumes are mounted on the containers of a given service by referring the volume from the [volumes field](/docs/0.10/reference/stacks/#volumes-string-optional) of the service.

```yaml
volumes:
  redis:
    driver_opts:
      size: 1Gi
```


Each volume has the following properties:

#### labels (string, optional)

Specify labels for the volume. They translates to Kubernetes annotations.

```yaml
labels:
  app: redis
```

#### driver_opts.class (string, optional)

Specify the storage class of the volume.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  class: standard
```

#### driver_opts.size (string, optional)

Specify the size of the volume. Defaults to 1Gi.

```yaml
driver_opts:
  size: 1Gi
```

## Environment variables

There are multiple parts of Okteto Stacks that deal with environment variables in one sense or another.
This section should help you find the information you need.

### Environment variable substitution

Itâ€™s possible to use environment variables in your shell to populate values inside your Okteto Stack:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: "app:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a file named `.env`.

### The .env file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in your Okteto Stack in an environment file named `.env`.
The `.env` file is placed at the same folder than the Okteto Stack manifest.

For example:

```console
$ cat .env
TAG=v1.5
```

```console
$ cat okteto-stack.yml
services:
   web:
      image: "app:${TAG}"
```

When you run `okteto stack deploy` the `web` container uses the image `app:v1.5`.

> Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file.


### extensions (object, optional)

Specifies a configuration that can be used in other services using anchors. Every top-level field starting with the prefix 'x-' will be interpreted as an extension.

```yaml
x-function: &environment
  environment:
    DEV_MODE: yes
    DB_HOST: postgres://${DB_HOST:-db}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
services:
  app:
    <<: *environment
    image: okteto.dev/example
```



### Okteto Secrets

You can also use your [Okteto Secrets](/docs/0.10/cloud/secrets/) in your Okteto Stack.

For example, if your have an Okteto Secret named `PASSWORD` whose value is `change-me!`, the following Okteto Stack:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}
```

will use `change-me!` for the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable of the `mysql` service when you run `okteto stack deploy`.

> Values in the shell and/or the `.env` file take precedence over those specified in Okteto Secrets.

## Okteto Cloud makes Docker Compose even more powerful!

Okteto Stacks extends the Compose Specification to make it even easier for you and your team to build cloud-native applications.

### name (string, optional)

The name of the Okteto Stack. Used by the Okteto UI to group the resources created by this stack. Defaults to the name of the git repository.
If the current path doesn't belong to a git repository, defaults to the name of the current folder.

```yaml
name: voting-app
```

### namespace (string, optional)

The namespace where you want to deploy your Okteto Stack. If not specified, it uses the current Okteto namespace.

```yaml
namespace: development
```

### endpoints ([object], optional)

Endpoints expose HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
Use this instead of having to run a NGINX proxy in your Docker Compose file.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - path: /
    service: frontend
    port: 80
  - path: /api
    service: api
    port: 8080
```

The endpoint uses the name of the stack to generate a URL with the following format: https://STACK_NAME-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net.

Each endpoint has the following properties:

#### path (string, required)

The request path that will handle this route.

#### service (string, required)

The service that will receive the request.

#### port (int, required)

The port that will receive the request.

If more than one endpoint is needed, you can declare multiple endpoints by using a map with the name of the endpoint and its specification:

```yaml
endpoints:
  landing:
    - path: /
      service: nginx
      port: 80
  web:
    - path: /
      service: frontend
      port: 80
    - path: /api
      service: api
      port: 8080
```

In this case, the URLs `landing-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net` and `web-NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net` are created.

`endpoints` also accepts an extended notation to specify labels for each endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  rules:
  - path: /
    service: frontend
    port: 3000
  - path: /api
    service: backend
    port: 8080
```
