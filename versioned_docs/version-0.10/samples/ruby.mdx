[Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) gives instant access to secure Kubernetes namespaces to enable developers to code, build, and run Kubernetes applications entirely in the cloud.

This tutorial will show you how to create an account in Okteto Cloud and how to develop a Ruby sample application.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Okteto CLI (>= 1.12.13). Follow this [guide](/docs/0.10/cloud/okteto-cli/) if you haven't done it yet.
- Configure Access to your Okteto Cloud Namespace [using the Okteto CLI](/docs/0.10/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-using-the-okteto-cli) or [using the Okteto Cloud UI](/docs/0.10/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-from-the-okteto-cloud-ui).


## Step 1: Deploy the Ruby Sample App

Get a local version of the Ruby Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/ruby-getting-started
$ cd ruby-getting-started
```

The `k8s.yml` file contains the [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of the Ruby Sample App. Deploy a dev version of the application by executing:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

```console
deployment.apps "hello-world" created
service "hello-world" created
```

Open your browser and go to the URL of the application. You can get the URL by logging into [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) and clicking on the application's endpoint:

Did you notice that you're accessing your application through an HTTPs endpoint? This is because Okteto Cloud will [automatically create them](/docs/0.10/cloud/ssl/) for you when you deploy your application. Cool no 😎?

## Step 2: Create your okteto manifest

To start developing on the Ruby Sample App you first need to create an okteto manifest.
With the Ruby Sample App deployed, run the following command to create your [okteto manifest](/docs/0.10/reference/manifest/):

```console
$ okteto init
```

```console
This command walks you through creating an okteto manifest.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.
See /docs/reference/manifest for the official documentation about the okteto manifest.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
Select the deployment you want to develop:
  ▸ hello-world
    Use default values
```

The `okteto init` command will scan the available deployments in your Kubernetes namespace and ask you to pick one.
Select the `hello-world` deployment. It's the one we deployed on the previous step.

```console
 ✓  hello-world
 ✓  Deployment 'hello-world' successfully analyzed
 ✓  okteto manifest (okteto.yml) created
 i  Run 'okteto up' to activate your development container
```

The `okteto init` command creates the following `okteto.yml` file:

```yaml
name: hello-world
command: bash
volumes:
  - /usr/local/bundle/cache
sync:
  - .:/opt/app
forward:
  - 8080:8080
  - 1234:1234
```

This file defines how to activate a development container for the Ruby Sample App:

- `name`: the name of the Kubernetes deployment you want to put on development mode.
- `command`: the start command of the development container.
- `volumes`: a list of paths in your development container to be mounted as persistent volumes. For example, this is useful to persist the bundle cache.
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the development container.
- `forward`: a list of ports to forward from your development container.

Also, the `okteto init` command creates a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your development container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, git metadata, or dependencies like the `vendor` folders.

## Step 3: Activate your development container

Next, execute the following command to activate your development container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 ✓  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ✓  Images successfully pulled
 ✓  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080
               1234 -> 1234

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your development container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application in hot-reload mode by running the following command:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> ruby app.rb
```

```console
[2020-03-20 09:23:04] INFO  WEBrick 1.6.0
[2020-03-20 09:23:04] INFO  ruby 2.7.0 (2019-12-25) [x86_64-linux]
== Sinatra (v2.0.8.1) has taken the stage on 8080 for development with backup from WEBrick
[2020-03-20 09:23:04] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=66 port=8080
```

## Step 4: Develop directly in Okteto Cloud

Open the `app.rb` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 7 to be *Hello world from the cluster!*. Save your changes.

```ruby
get "/" do
  message = "Hello world from the cluster!"
  message
end
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your development container in Kubernetes and Sinatra automatically detects them and reloads your application.

Go back to the browser and reload the page. Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required 😎!

## Step 5: Debug directly in Okteto Cloud

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE. Let's take a look at how that works in VS Code, one of the most popular IDEs for Ruby development. If you haven't done it yet, install the [Ruby extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) available from Visual Studio marketplace. This extension comes with debug definitions covering the default `ruby-debug-ide` client setup.

Now, cancel the execution of `ruby app.rb` from the development container shell by pressing `ctrl + c`. Rerun your application in debug mode:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> rdebug-ide --host 0.0.0.0 app.rb
```

```console
Fast Debugger (ruby-debug-ide 0.7.0, debase 0.2.4.1, file filtering is supported) listens on 0.0.0.0:1234
```

Open the _Run_  view in VS Code and run the *Connect to okteto* debug configuration (or press the F5 shortcut):

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Connect to okteto",
            "type": "Ruby",
            "request": "attach",
            "remotePort": "1234",
            "remoteHost": "localhost",
            "remoteWorkspaceRoot": "/opt/app",
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
        }
    ]
}
```

> You should be replacing the value of `remoteWorkspaceRoot` with wherever your application code is.

Add a breakpoint on `app.rb`, line 8. Go back to the browser and reload the page. The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc...

Your code is executing in Okteto Cloud, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools. Pretty cool no? 😉

## Next steps

Congratulations, you just developed **your first application in Okteto Cloud** 🚀.

> Okteto lets you develop your applications directly in Kubernetes. This way you can:
> - Eliminate integration issues by developing in a realistic environment
> - Test your application end to end as fast as you type code
> - No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Develop at the speed of the cloud!

Okteto uses the `okteto.yml` file to determine the name of your development container, the docker image to use, and where to upload your code. Check the [Okteto manifest docs](/docs/reference/manifest/) to customize your development containers with your own dev tools, images, and dependencies to adapt Okteto to your own application.
