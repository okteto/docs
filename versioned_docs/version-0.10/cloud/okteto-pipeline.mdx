Okteto Pipelines allow you to configure how your [Git repositories](/docs/0.10/cloud/deploy-from-git) get deployed to [Okteto Cloud](/docs/0.10/cloud/). You might want to use them if Okteto Cloud cannot detect how to deploy your application from your [deployment manifests](/docs/0.10/cloud/deploy-from-git#prerequisites) or simply when you want more control over how your application gets deployed. 

### Example okteto-pipeline.yml

```yaml
icon: https://apps.okteto.com/movies/icon.png
deploy:
  - okteto build -t okteto.dev/api:${OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT} api
  - okteto build -t okteto.dev/frontend:${OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT} frontend
  - helm upgrade --install movies chart --set tag=${OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT}
devs:
  - api/okteto.yml
  - frontend/okteto.yml
```

### Schema Reference

- `icon`: the icon associated to your application in the Okteto Cloud Dashboard (optional).
- `deploy`: list of commands to deploy your application in your Kubernetes namespace. It is usually a combination of `helm`, `kubectl`, and `okteto` commands.
- `destroy`: list of commands to be executed when the pipeline is destroyed. It can be used to release any resource created outside Okteto.
- `devs`: the paths to the okteto manifests in your Git repository. This is used to fill the hints in the *Develop* dialog of each service (optional).

For example, the above example builds fresh docker images for the api and frontend components of the [Movies App](https://github.com/okteto/movies), pushes these images to the [Okteto Registry](/docs/0.10/cloud/registry/) and deploys the app with Helm.

### Built-in tools

Okteto will run an installation job that clones your Git repository, checks out the selected branch, and executes the sequence of `deploy` commands. The job will fail if any of the commands in the `deploy` list fails.

The installation job will run in a Debian Linux container with the following tools preinstalled:

- `bash`
- `bazel`
- `cue`
- `curl`
- `envsubst`
- `git`
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `make`
- `okteto`
- `openssh`
- `wait-for-it`

The installation job container is automatically configured with credentials to use the above tools on the namespace where your application is deployed.

### Built-in Environment Variables
The installation job also populates the following environment variables. You can refer to this in your `deploy` commands if needed:

- `OKTETO_NAMESPACE`: the namespace where your application is going to be installed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_BRANCH`: the name of the Git branch currently being deployed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT`: the SHA1 hash of the last commit of the branch.
- `OKTETO_REGISTRY_URL`: the url of the [Okteto Registry](/docs/0.10/cloud/registry/).
- `BUILDKIT_HOST`: the address of the [Okteto Cloud buildkit instance](/docs/0.10/cloud/build/). You can use it to build your images with any CLI tool that supports Buildkit builds.
