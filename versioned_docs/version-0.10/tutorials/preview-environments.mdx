In this section, we'll show you how to automatically create a preview environment for your applications using Okteto and GitHub Actions.

## Pre-Requisites
- An [Okteto account](https://cloud.okteto.com)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)

For this tutorial, we'll be using [this application](https://github.com/okteto/kubernetes-preview-environment).

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the [kubernetes-preview-environment](https://github.com/okteto/kubernetes-preview-environment) repository with your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Create the GitHub Workflow

To create the preview environments, we're going to use our [GitHub Actions for Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/actions).

Creating a preview environment requires performing the following steps:

1. Login to Okteto.
1. Deploy a preview environment in Okteto.
1. Update the PR with the URL of the preview environment.

The sample repository configured to use [the workflow described above](https://github.com/okteto/kubernetes-preview-environment/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yaml). If you want to use this one for your own repositories, all you need to do is to create a `.github/workflow` folder in the root of your repo, and save your workflow file in it.

The workflow file to create the preview environments looks like this:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/preview.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}
        
    - name: Deploy preview environment
      uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
      env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
        scope: personal
        timeout: 15m
```

## Step 3: Configure your Okteto API Token

If you noticed, the workflow uses the `secrets:OKTETO_TOKEN`. We do this so we don't have to commit the token into our repo. Before you run this workflow you need to create the `OKTETO_TOKEN` secret in your repository, with your Okteto API token as the value.

[Get your Okteto API token here](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/settings/setup).

Learn more about repository secrets in [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables).

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are in your repository, go ahead an open a new pull request. GitHub will receive the event, and it will start your workflow. You can see the status and logs of the workflow in the `checks` section of the pull request.

## Step 5: See your changes live

After a few seconds, the workflow will update the pull request with the URL of your preview environment. Click on it to see the changes in real time.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/tutorials/images/message.png" alt="Preview environment available message with URL" width="650" /></p>

Every time a new commit is pushed to the branch, the same workflow will run, automatically updating the preview environment.

## Step 6: Cleanup

The sample repo also includes a workflow [to cleanup the preview environments](https://github.com/okteto/kubernetes-preview-environment/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml) once the pull request is closed. We recommend you follow this pattern to remove the preview environment after the pull request has been merged.

```
# preview-closed.yaml
on: 
  pull_request: 
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@master

    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: Destroy preview environment
      uses: okteto/destroy-preview@latest
      with:
        name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}-cindylopez
```

## Conclusions

Having automatic preview environments launched along with your pull requests is a great way to do end-to-end testing and to get feedback from your entire team on any code changes. But that's not all. This is also a fantastic way to enable your sales or support team to spin up demo environments without having to depend on the dev team.
