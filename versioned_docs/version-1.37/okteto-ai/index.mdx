description: Create a preview environment for your application using Okteto
---

Okteto AI is Okteto's orchestration layer for running multiple AI agents inside Okteto's isolated, ephemeral development environments. Powered by Claude Code from Anthropic, each agent operates independently with its own container, filesystem, logs, and access policies, ensuring safe, observable, and reproducible workflows for modern software development.

Whether you're adding a new feature to your application, spinning up a new project, or exploring multiple features in parallel, Okteto AI lets you move faster without compromising on safety or control.

> **Beta Notice:** Okteto AI is currently in beta. If you don't yet have access, you can request to be added to our Beta by visiting [okteto.com/ai](https://www.okteto.com/ai).


## What is Okteto AI?

Okteto AI enables you to run a fleet of AI agents in parallel, each working independently on different tasks. An Okteto Agent is a Claude Code-powered assistant that can write, modify, test, and debug code inside an Okteto development environment. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, these agents have full access to a real, containerized development environment where they can perform independent tasks such as:

- **Repository Onboarding**: Understanding existing codebases, analyzing architecture, and preparing to work with your specific tech stack
- **Application Scaffolding**: Creating new services, APIs, or full applications from natural language descriptions
- **Feature Development**: Adding new functionality, endpoints, or UI components
- **Code Refactoring**: Modernizing legacy code, improving performance, or updating to new patterns
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving issues with full context of your environment
- **Test Writing**: Creating comprehensive test suites for existing or new code
- **Documentation**: Generating or updating technical documentation, READMEs, and API specs

Each agent runs inside its own Kubernetes namespace, backed by Okteto‚Äôs dev environment stack. This gives you:
- **Full isolation**: Agents don‚Äôt share state or files unless explicitly configured
- **Production-like environment**: Access to the same runtime, secrets, and configuration as your real dev setup
- **Test-first execution**: Agents run tests, validate changes, and generate logs before making pull requests
- **No local dependencies**: Nothing is run or installed on your machine
- **Complete observability**: Full logs, metrics, and traces of all agent actions



## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Administrators
Before team members can use Okteto AI, organization administrators must configure the feature. See the [Administrator Configuration Guide](okteto-ai/okteto-ai-admin-config.mdx) for detailed setup instructions.

### For Developers

Review our [**Okteto AI Getting Started Guide**](okteto-ai/ai-getting-started.mdx)


## Security and Isolation

Each AI Agent runs in a sandboxed Namespace with limited access to only the resources it needs. All actions occur inside an ephemeral environment, with observability built in. This ensures safe experimentation and protects production environments.


## Example Use Cases

- **Spin up a new service** from a prompt like:  
  _‚ÄúCreate a new TypeScript REST API with an /alive endpoint and a README‚Äù_

- **Refactor legacy code** with:  
  _‚ÄúUpdate this repo to use async/await instead of callbacks‚Äù_

- **Add a feature in parallel** to existing work:
  _‚ÄúAdd a banner to the homepage announcing the beta launch‚Äù_


## FAQs

**Can I run multiple agents at once?**  
Yes! You can launch multiple agents in parallel, each working independently.

**Do I need to install anything locally?**  
No. Okteto handles everything in the cloud. You don't need Docker or Kubernetes installed.

**Can I bring my own LLM key?**  
Yes. You can optionally provide your own Anthropic LLM key in the agent settings if you want to use your own quota or a different provider.

**Do you plan on adding support for additional LLM Providers?**
Yes! We plan on adding support for additional models based on your feedback in a coming release.
