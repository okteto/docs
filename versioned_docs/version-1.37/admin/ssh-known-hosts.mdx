The SSH Known Hosts feature enables Okteto administrators to centrally manage trusted SSH hosts for all Git operations across the organization. By maintaining a single source of truth for the `known_hosts` file, you can ensure secure and reliable repository cloning without requiring custom runner images.

## Key Benefits

- **Centralized trust management** - Manage SSH host keys in one place for all teams
- **Enhanced security** - Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying host keys
- **Simplified operations** - No need for custom images or per-job SSH configuration

## Getting Started

### Enabling Known Hosts
- Navigate to **Admin → Settings → Known Hosts**
- Toggle **Enable Known Hosts** to activate the feature (disabled by default)
- Once enabled:
  - Okteto uses this centralized list for all SSH operations
  - Automatic `ssh-keyscan` is disabled unless explicitly called in commands
  - All Git clones and submodules honor this trust store

### Configure Trusted Hosts
- Add entries directly in the [OpenSSH `known_hosts` format](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8#SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE_FORMAT)
- Well-known providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) are included as commented placeholders

## How It Works

### Scope and Application
The centralized `known_hosts` applies to:
- **Installer jobs** - UI-triggered deploys, previews, and destroy operations
- **Remote executor commands** - Commands run from the Okteto Manifest
- **CLI operations** - When using `okteto deploy --remote`
  
### Runtime Behavior
- The `known_hosts` file is mounted read-write in jobs (allowing runtime additions for dynamic hosts)
- When using `okteto deploy --remote`, the server-level configuration always overrides local `known_hosts`
- Changes made during job execution are ephemeral and don't modify the global configuration
  
### How This Affects the Okteto CLI
- Remote executions automatically fetch the centralized list
- CLI honors the centralized `known_hosts` when `okteto deploy --remote` is used

## Example Configuration
When cloning repositories, the system automatically configures Git to use the centralized hosts file:
```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/okteto/known_hosts -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes"
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Working with Dynamic Hosts
- Pipelines that clone additional repositories succeed as long as each host appears in the centralized `known_hosts`
- Users can still run `ssh-keyscan` explicitly in their commands to add hosts at runtime
- Dynamic endpoints created during deploy can append entries to the mounted `known_hosts` within the job. These changes are ephemeral to the job and do not modify the admin-configured global template

### Error Handling
If a host is missing from the list:
- Cloning will fail with **Host key verification failed**
