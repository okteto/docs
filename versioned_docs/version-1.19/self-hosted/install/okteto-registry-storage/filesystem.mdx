This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Okteto Registry with filesystem persistency to store your container images.

Filesystem storage might limit your ability to scale up the registry, depending on the type of storage you are using.

In your Helm configuration file, set `filesystem.enabled` to true if you want to store the images in the container filesystem.

Additionally, set `filesystem.persistence.enabled` to true if you want to store the images in a PVC attached to the Okteto Registry.
You can also customize the `storageClass` (optional), the `size` of the volume (defaults to 40Gi), or attach a pre-existing persistent volume claim via `claimName`.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
registry:
  storage:
    filesystem:
      enabled: true
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        claimName: ""
        accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
        storageClass: ""
        size: 40Gi
```

Finally, [upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.
