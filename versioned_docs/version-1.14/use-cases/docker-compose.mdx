Our docker-compose integration makes it easy for teams to use Okteto, even when they're not on Kubernetes.

Remote development with Okteto doesn't requre an active docker session. Instead, you'll have a persistent volume, 
instant file syncrhonization, and an accessible public endpoint to view your changes while developing your app locally.
