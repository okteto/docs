# Bring your own Wildcard Certificate

For this, you'll need the private and public keys of your certificate. The certificate must be a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate in PKCS1 format, with `*.SUBDOMAIN` as its `Subject Alternative Name`.

Import the secret into your kubernetes cluster by running the command below:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls ${CERT_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE} --namespace okteto
```
Where `CERT_NAME` is `your-ssl-certificate-secret`.

After you create the secret, add the following to your Helm configuration file to tell Okteto and NGINX to use your certificate.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: your-ssl-certificate-secret

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/your-ssl-certificate-secret
```

You can use any certificate provider you are familiar with if it's compatible with the x.509 and PKCS1 standards.
For example, we have a guide maintained by the community to [configure your certificate with GoDaddy](https://community.okteto.com/t/how-do-i-bring-my-godaddy-certificate-to-okteto/578/1).

Finally, [upgrade](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) your Okteto installation for the new configuration to be applied.

:::info
If [`publicOverride`](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#publicoverride) is set, its value must also be included in the certificate's `Subject Alternative Name` list. For example, if you use `dev.example.com` as the `publicOverride`, and `okteto.net` as the `subdomain`, you need to generate a certificate that includes `*.okteto.net` and `dev.example.com` in the `Subject Alternative Name` list.

# Bring your own Certificate Authority

By default, Okteto will trust a certificate issued by any well-know certificate authority. If your certificate is self-signed, issued by a new certificate authority, or issued by a private certificate authority, you'll need to import your certificate authority's public key.

First import your certificate authority by running the command below:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic ${CA_NAME} --from-file=ca.crt=${CA_FILE} --namespace okteto
```
Where `CA_NAME` is your `your-ca-secret`.

After you create the secret, add the following to your Helm configuration file to tell Okteto to use your certificate authority:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
wildcardCertificate:
  create: false
  name: your-ssl-certificate-secret
  privateCA:
    enabled: true
    secret:
      name: your-ca-secret
      key: ca.crt

ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    extraArgs:
      default-ssl-certificate: $(POD_NAMESPACE)/your-ssl-certificate-secret
```

Finally, [upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.
