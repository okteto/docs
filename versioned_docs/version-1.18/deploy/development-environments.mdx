Development images allow you to configure the runtime of your Development Containers.
Instead of having to keep a wiki with a never-ending list of tools, dependencies, and scripts to install and run, you can pack all of it in the development images of your Development Containers.

## Overview

At a high level, a development image is a Docker container image that contains:

- One or more language runtimes (e.g python, ruby, node)
- SDKs for your language runtime (e.g JDK, python-dev)
- Binary dependencies (e.g. openssl, git)
- Tools to manage and install dependencies (e.g. pip, bundler, yarn)
- Tools to run your tests and analyze your code (e.g nosetest, pylint)
- Your source code

Out of the box, Okteto maintains pre-configured development images in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/okteto/devenv) for the following languages:

- dotnetcore
- golang
- java
- node
- php
- python
- ruby
- rust

## Create your own

The default development images are a great way to start.
They use the latest official docker images for your language runtime and include the most common developer tools and a custom bash prompt.
But they might not have everything you need. Your team might need to support a very specific version of your runtime, or you might need some extra tooling available.

Do the following to create your own development image:

1. Create a Dockerfile
1. Pick a base image
1. Add your extra dependencies, tools, and files
1. Build your image in the [build](manifest/overview-manifest.mdx#build) section of the Okteto manifest
1. Update the `image` key in your `okteto.yaml` with your new image using the [OKTETO_BUILD_XXX](manifest/okteto-variables.mdx#built-in-environment-variables-for-images-in-okteto-registry) variables

Besides following [Docker's best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/), we also recommend the following:

- Pin all your dependencies, so there aren't any surprises
- Keep the Dockerfile in your repository, next to your code
- When using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), use your builder stage to build your development image
