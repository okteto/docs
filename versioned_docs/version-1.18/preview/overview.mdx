Preview environments allow you to include a live preview of your changes on every pull request. This is a fantastic way to collaborate with your team's technical, as well as non-technical members, to receive early feedback.

Okteto's preview environments are powered by Kubernetes and easily integrate with your favorite source control and CI/CD provider. They work using the [Okteto manifest](manifest/overview-manifest.mdx), so are very simple to get started with.

- [GitHub](preview/github/using-github-actions.mdx)
- [GitLab](preview/using-gitlab-cicd.mdx)
- Bitbucket Pipelines (coming soon!)
- Azure DevOps (coming soon!)

## Prerequisites

Preview environments deploy the code in a pull request to [Okteto](index.md). You can configure the way your code gets deployed using the [Okteto manifest](core/using-okteto-cli.mdx#deployment-manifests)'s `deploy` section.
