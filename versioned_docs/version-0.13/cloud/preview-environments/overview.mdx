Preview environments allow you to include a live preview of your changes on every pull request. This is a fantastic way to collaborate with your team's technical, as well as non-technical members, to receive early feedback.

Okteto's preview environments are powered by Kubernetes and easily integrate with your favorite source control and CI/CD provider. They work using the [Okteto manifest](/docs/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest), so are very simple to get started with.
You can use Preview Environments with either [Okteto Cloud](/docs/cloud) or with [Okteto Self-Hosted](/docs/0.13/enterprise) if you want to run them on your Kubernetes infrastructure.

- [GitLab](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments-gitlab/)
- Circle CI (coming soon!)
- Bitbucket Pipelines (coming soon!)
- CodeFresh (coming soon!)

## Prerequisites

Preview environments deploy the code in a pull request to [Okteto](/docs/welcome/overview/). You can configure the way your code gets deployed using the [Okteto manifest](/docs/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest)'s `deploy` section.
