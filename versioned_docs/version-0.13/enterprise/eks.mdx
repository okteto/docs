This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We'll be focusing exclusively on EKS in order to keep it as simple as possible.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you'll need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3
- A GitHub OAuth application
- An IAM user
- An S3 bucket
- An Okteto License (optional)

### Subdomain

You'll need to have access to a internet accessible subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com. Let's Encrypt servers must be able to resolve the addresses in order to issue the required certificates.

This guide will assume that your domain is registered in [Amazon Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). Other DNS services can be used, but aren't covered here.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow Amazon's [cluster creation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html).

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.19 or newer
- A pool with at least 3 `m4.xlarge` nodes
- 100 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto

### Installing kubectl

Follow Amazon's documentation for [installing kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to [talk to your new cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

### Installing Helm v3

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Creating the GitHub OAuth application

> Okteto supports OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, or OpenID Connect to handle user authentication. For this guide, we'll focus on using GitHub. All the supported configuration settings [are described here](/docs/0.13/enterprise/administration/configuration/#auth).

Follow GitHub's official documentation on [how to create an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

When creating the OAuth App, you will need to provide the following values:

**Homepage URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN
```

**Authorization callback URL**:
```
https://okteto.DOMAIN/auth/callback
```

You'll use the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` when installing Okteto.

### Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket

Okteto uses S3 to store your private images. Follow Amazon's [guide on how to create s3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html). Create the bucket in the region as your EKS cluster, and keep it private.

### Creating an IAM

The Okteto sub-components need access to Route 53 (to fulfill the ACME challenge for the certificates) and S3 (for uploading and downloading your container images).

We recommend you follow AWS' official documentation on [how to create and manage IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) for more information on this.

You'll need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create an `IAM User`
1. Create a set of Access keys for your `IAM User` and save them locally. We'll be using this when installing Okteto.
1. Create an `IAM Role`
1. Attach the following permission policy to the IAM Role (replace `YOUR_BUCKET` with your `s3` bucket name):

      ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "route53:GetChange",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                  "Resource": "*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket",
                      "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                      "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:PutObject",
                      "s3:GetObject",
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                      "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/*"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```



## Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

Okteto is free for small teams.  You get all the features of [Okteto](/docs/0.13/enterprise/) for up to 3 users with 3 namespaces each.

Want to use Okteto with a bigger team? [Let's talk](https://okteto.com/#talktous)

## Installing Okteto

### Creating the Okteto namespace

Create a dedicated namespace for your Okteto instance, and the required CRDs:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://charts.okteto.com/namespace.yaml
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://charts.okteto.com/crds.yaml
```

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Create a Kubernetes secret with the IAM User's Access secret key you created before:

```console
kubectl create secret generic okteto-cloud-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=key=IAM_ACCESS_SECRET
```

Download a copy of the [Okteto EKS configuration file](/docs/self-hosted/eks/config.yaml), open it, and update the following values:
- Your `email`
- Your `license` (optional)
- A `subdomain`
- `clientId` and `clientSecret` of the OAuth Application you created
- Your cluster's API server endpoint
- The name of the `bucket` you created
- The `Access key ID` of the IAM User

> You can also configure Okteto to assume a role instead of using access keys. Check the [AWS section in the configuration page](/docs/0.13/enterprise/administration/configuration/#cloud) to learn more.

For example:

```yaml
email: admin@example.com
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com
cluster:
  endpoint: "https://XXXXXX.gr7.us-west-2.eks.amazonaws.com"

auth:
  github:
    enabled: true
    clientId: ae8924d074d8c8809999
    clientSecret: ABCD90598b706d5342f07cce18fee5e5da391234

cloud:
  provider:
    aws:
      enabled: true
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: okteto-private-images
      iam:
        accessKeyID: "XXXXXX"

buildkit:
  ingress:
    enabled: false
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto-enterprise -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto
```

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the NGINX controller service External-IP:
- "*.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto

2. Create the following DNS record, pointing it to the Buildkit service External-IP:
- "buildkit.dev.example.com"

You can retrieve the External IP by running:
    kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto

3. Once you create both DNS entries you can access your Okteto instance at this URL:
https://okteto.dev.example.com
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

We can use the instructions `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by EKS to the NGINX Ingress we've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP                          PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller  LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    a519c8b3b27f94...elb.amazonaws.com   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. In Route 53, this is done by creating an `A` record with the name  `*`, pointing to the alias of the Elastic Load Balancer.

> Note: avoid using a `CNAME` record for `*` pointing to the public hostname of the Elastic Load Balancer, as it will block the cert-manager default capability for issuing/renewing certificates via ACME dns01.

### Retrieve the Buildkit IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by EKS to the Buildkit instance you've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=okteto,app.kubernetes.io/component=buildkit --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                           PORT(S)          AGE
okteto-okteto-enterprise-buildkit     LoadBalancer   10.245.142.73   a519c8b3b27f95...elb.amazonaws.com    1234:32449/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. This is done by creating an `A` record with the name `buildkit`.

## Sign in to your Okteto

You can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as you soon as you click the `Login` button.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues during this guide, we recommend you check these things first:

1. `okteto.SUBDOMAIN` resolves to the IP address you retrieved.
1. If you get a certificate warning, there has been a problem with Let's Encrypt. This is usually related to DNS resolution, the need to retry, or the permissions of the credentials created.
