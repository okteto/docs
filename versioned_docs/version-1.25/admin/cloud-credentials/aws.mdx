This guide walks you through configuring AWS credentials for your Okteto instance to enable the commands in your Okteto Manifests to interact with your AWS account.

We will focus on requesting access to an S3 bucket. However, you can extend this approach to grant access to other AWS resources by specifying a role with the necessary permissions.

AWS credentials are configured using [OIDC federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html) to [assume an IAM Role via Web Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.html).
This provides secure and temporary access to your AWS resources.

## Step 1: Register the Identity Provider

:::info
We recommend installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) before following this tutorial
:::

The first step in configuring AWS credentials is to register your Kubernetes cluster as an OIDC identity provider in AWS.
To do this, Okteto provides the OIDC endpoint of your cluster, which can be found in the General section of your Okteto Admin Dashboard.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/amazon-ecr-oidc-config.png").default}
    alt="OIDC configuration in admin general view"
  />
</p>

Store these values as environment variables, you will use them in the next steps:

```bash
export OIDC_ENDPOINT=https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster
export OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=system:serviceaccount:okteto:okteto
```

The `AUDIENCE` is traditionally the client ID of the requester, and tokens will only be exchanged for these audiences.
It corresponds to the `aud` field in the JWT payload. We recommend creating a unique audience for each Okteto instance and AWS region.
For example:

```bash
export AUDIENCE=okteto.example.com/us-east-2
```

Next, run the following command to create the OIDC identity provider in AWS:


```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider --url "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}" --client-id-list "${AUDIENCE}"
```

Once successful, youâ€™ll see a response similar to:

```yaml
{
    "OpenIDConnectProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:oidc-provider/container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster"
}
```

Store this value in an environment variable, you'll use in the next step:

```bash
export ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::112233445566:oidc-provider/container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/clusters/myCluster
```

## Step 2: Create the IAM Role and Grant Access to S3

In this step, you'll create an IAM Role that allows access to S3 and configure it to assume the role using the OIDC identity provider you set up in the previous step.

First, create the trust policy that allows the role to be assumed by the OIDC identity provider.
Save the following content to a file called `trust-policy.json` (replace your environment variables):

```yaml title="trust-policy.json"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "${ROLE_ARN}"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:aud": "${AUDIENCE}",
          "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:sub": "${OKTETO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run the following command to create the IAM Role in AWS with the trust policy you defined:

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name okteto-credentials --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

You will receive a response similar to:

```yaml
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "okteto-credentials",
        "RoleId": "AR...",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/okteto-credentials",
        "CreateDate": "2024-06-10T15:04:05+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, attach the S3 policy to the IAM Role to grant it full read and write access to your S3 buckets:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name okteto-credentials --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
```

This grants the IAM Role the necessary permissions to interact with S3.


## Step 3: Configure AWS Cloud Credentials in Okteto

Now that you've created the IAM role, the final step is to configure the AWS credentials in Okteto.

Go to the [Cloud Credentials view](index.mdx) view in the Okteto Admin dashboard and enable the AWS IAM Role option.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src={require("@site/static/img/aws-cloud-credentials.png").default}
    alt="AWS IAM Role"
  />
</p>

Provide the following information:

- **Role ARN**: The Role ARN `ROLE_ARN` you created in Step 1
- **Region**: The AWS Region for the AWS STS Regional Endpoint. You can find more information about regional endpoints [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sts-regionalized-endpoints.html)
- **Audience**: The Audience `AUDIENCE` you specified during the Identity Provider setup

Once this configuration is in place, your Okteto Manifests commands will have access to your AWS account.

## Example Okteto Manifest

With the configuration complete, the following Okteto Manifest can interact with the specified S3 bucket:

```yaml
deploy:
  image: amazon/aws-cli
  commands:
    - aws s3 mb s3://test-bucket --region us-west-2

test:
  aws:
    image: amazon/aws-cli
    commands:
      - aws s3 ls | grep test-bucket

destroy:
  image: amazon/aws-cli
  commands:
    - aws s3 rb s3://test-bucket --region us-west-2
```
