This tutorial will show you how to develop an application with Okteto using Docker Compose files.
[Docker Compose](/docs/next/reference/compose/) are for developers who don't want to deal with the complexities of Kubernetes manifests.
Okteto implements and extends the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) to make it easy to develop Docker Compose applications on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Okteto CLI. Follow this [guide](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/) if you haven't done it yet.
- Configure Access to your Okteto Cloud Namespace [using the Okteto CLI](/docs/next/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-using-the-okteto-cli) or [using the Okteto Cloud UI](/docs/next/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-from-the-okteto-cloud-ui).

## Step 1: Launch your Development Environment

Get a local version of the Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/compose-getting-started
$ cd compose-getting-started
```

The Sample App is a simple web application implemented using Python, with Redis for storage.
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the components of the Sample App:

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    command: python app.py
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - ./vote:/src

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

volumes:
  redis:
```

The equivalent Kubernetes manifests would have more than 300 lines of yaml!

Deploying the Sample App is as simple as executing this command:

```console
$ okteto deploy --wait
```

```console
 i  Using pchico83 @ cloud.okteto.com as context
 ✓  Deploying compose
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://vote-cindy.cloud.okteto.net/
 ✓  Development environment 'compose-getting-started' successfully deployed
 i  Run 'okteto up' to activate your development container
```

The `deploy` command will create the necessary deployments, services, persistent volumes, and ingress rules needed to run the Sample App.  Cool no 😎?

Open your browser and go to the URL of your development environment, shown as part of the `okteto deploy` logs (https://vote-cindy.cloud.okteto.net/ in this case).

## Step 2: Developing time!

In order to hot-reload your application in your remote development environment, run the this command:

```console
$ okteto up vote
```

```
 i  Using pchico83 @ cloud.okteto.com as context
 i  Development environment 'compose-getting-started' already deployed.
 i  To redeploy your development environment run 'okteto deploy' or 'okteto up vote --deploy'
 ✓  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ✓  Images successfully pulled
 ✓  Files synchronized
    Context:   cloud.okteto.com
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      vote
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080

 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on all addresses.
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 * Running on http://10.8.35.69:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 838-277-059
```

From this moment, all you code changes will be immediatelly synched and hot-reloaded by your development environment.
For example, open the `vote/app.py` file in your IDE and modify the voting options on lines 16-17.

```python
def getOptions():
    option_a = "Local development"
    option_b = "Cloud development"
```

Save your changes. Check the output of your development environment:

```console
 * Detected change in '/src/app.py', reloading
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 838-277-059
```

Access the URL of your application again.
Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required!


## Next steps

Congratulations, you just developed **your first application in Okteto Cloud** 🚀.

Read the docs for the [Docker Compose](/docs/next/reference/compose/) and the [available Okteto CLI commands](/docs/next/reference/cli) to learn more about developing your Docker Compose application on Okteto.

Head over to our getting started guides for [Go](/docs/next/samples/golang/#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), [ASP.NET](/docs/next/samples/aspnetcore#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), [Java](/docs/next/samples/java/#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), [Node.js](/docs/next/samples/node#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), [PHP](/docs/next/samples/php/#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), [Python](/docs/next/samples/python/#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud), or [Ruby](/docs/next/samples/ruby/#step-4-debug-directly-in-okteto-cloud) to see how to configure Okteto to live-update your application with different programming languages and **debuggers**.
