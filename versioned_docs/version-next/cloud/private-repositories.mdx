## GitHub Private Repositories

Okteto integrates with GitHub and allows you to easily deploy any repository from any account or organization you grant permissions to. You can connect both personal repositories and those belonging to an organization in the same Okteto account.

### Grant permissions

You'll need to perform the following steps the first time you grant GitHub permissions to Okteto:

1. Log into Okteto Cloud
1. Click on the "**Launch Dev Environment**" button on the top
1. Make sure "**GitHub**" is the selected source

1. Click on the **Configure GitHub** button, to open the authorization dialog from GitHub. GitHub will ask you to install the Okteto Cloud App in the accounts and organizations you select. Follow the instructions to grant permissions to your repositories.

1. Finally click on the **Install & Authorize** button to proceed. If you're not the administrator of the organization, GitHub will send an email notification to your administrator and wait for their authorization to complete the installation and grant you access.

Once you or your administrator grants permission, Okteto will automatically list your private and public repositories in the **Launch** dialog.

Private repositories will be identified by a "lock" icon.

### GitHub org administrators

If you're an administrator, you can grant team members access to your organization's repositories. Please note, even if you grant Okteto permission to all of your organization's repositories, each developer will only have access to those repositories that they are able to access through GitHub. This allows you to maintain security, and ensure that only those authorized to access code may do so.

### Update permissions

You can update or revoke the permissions over your private repositories or organizations by going to the [**Integrations** tab](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/settings/integrations) in the **Settings** page.

Click on the **Configure** button to update your permissions and access GitHub's configuration flow.

### Launch from a Private GitHub Repository

After giving Okteto access to any of your public or private repositories, you'll be able to deploy from a GitHub repository [using an Okteto Manifest](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest).
