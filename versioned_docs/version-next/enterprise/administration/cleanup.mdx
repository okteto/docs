## Sleeping resources

To automatically save resources in your cluster, you can configure Okteto Enterprise to automatically scale inactive applications and resources to zero after a period of inactivity.

You can enable and customize the inactivity period via the [garbage collector's settings](/docs/next/enterprise/administration/configuration/#gc).


## Inactive Applications and Resources

Okteto Enterprise considers an application or resources inactive if a user hasn't performed any of the following tasks during the inactivity period:

- Upgrade or redeploy via the UI or the command line.
- Launched a development container with `okteto up`.
- Pushed the latest version of your code with `okteto push`.

Service accounts, config maps, secrets, or volumes you create will be unaffected by this operation.

## Wake sleeping resources

Okteto's UI will notify you when there are sleeping resources in your namespace. Press the **Wake all** button to activate all sleeping resources at once.

Sleeping resources are also started if anyone visits any of the public endpoints of your application.

## Persistent resources

In case you are interested on the garbage collector but you want to skip some specific namespace, you can mark it as `persistent`. To do so, you can add the label `dev.okteto.com/persistent` to it or [use the admin view](/docs/next/enterprise/administration/dashboard/#namespaces-section).

In case you want more granularity and only want to persist specific deployments or statefulsets within a namespace, you can include the label `dev.okteto.com/persistent` on those resources. In that case, the garbage collector will ignore only those specific resources while scaling down the rest of the namespace.

## Delete Unused Namespaces

You can also configure Okteto Enterprise to delete unused namespaces after a period of inactivity. You can enable and customize the inactivity period via the [garbage collector's settings](/docs/next/enterprise/administration/configuration/#gc).
