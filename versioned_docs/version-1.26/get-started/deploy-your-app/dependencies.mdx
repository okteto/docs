The Movies app requires an instance of MongoDB to be running in your Development Environment.

You could deploy MongoDB as part of your `deploy` section in the `okteto.yaml` file, but in this case, you are going to use the repo https://github.com/okteto/mongodb as a dependency.
This repo is already pre-configured with a Docker Compose file to deploy MongoDB in Okteto.

To instruct Okteto to deploy this repository in your Development Environment, add the following section to your `okteto.yaml` file:

```yaml title="okteto.yaml"
dependencies:
  mongodb:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/mongodb
    wait: true
    variables:
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: password    
```

The `wait` flag instructs Okteto to wait until MongoDB is ready before running the deploy commands.

The `variables` field can be used to customize the deployment of the dependency, in this case to set the MongoDB password.

:::note

Deploy the Movies app to apply the changes:

```bash
okteto deploy
```

```bash
 i  Using cindy @ okteto.example.com as context
 i  Deploying dependency 'mongodb'
 ...
 âœ“  Repository 'mongodb' successfully deployed
 i  Running 'Helm Install'
Release "movies" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: movies
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 19 23:54:00 2024
NAMESPACE: cindy
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Success! Your application will be available shortly.
 i  Endpoints available:
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com
  - https://movies-cindy.okteto.example.com/api
 âœ“  Development environment 'movies' successfully deployed
```

You can see that MongoDB is now running from the Okteto UI:

<Image
  src={require("@site/static/img/movies-mongodb-ui.png").default}
  alt="Movies Onboard MongoDB"

/>

And the `seed` job has now successfully initialized the MongoDB data.

:::note
Running seed data scripts can be slow with real world databases. For those scenarios, you can use our [Volume Snapshots](core/use-volume-snapshots.mdx) feature to clone this data from an existing database in seconds ðŸš€

## Next Steps

But the Okteto CLI is informing us that `There are no available endpoints for 'movies'`...

Let's [create endpoints for your app](endpoints.mdx) in the next step of this guide ðŸ˜Ž
