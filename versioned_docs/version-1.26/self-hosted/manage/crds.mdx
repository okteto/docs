As part of Okteto's installation, some Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed in your cluster. These CRDs are used by Okteto to mainly store different information. You can see the list of CRDs installed by Okteto exploring the folder `crds` in the templates of the [Okteto Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/okteto/okteto) or by running the following command in your cluster:

```console
kubectl get crd | grep okteto.com
```

You can let Okteto install these CRDs or you can install them manually on your own, but be aware they are needed for Okteto to work properly. You can use the [following configuration setting](self-hosted/helm-configuration.mdx#crds) to let Okteto know if it should install them or not. By default, Okteto will install them.

## Private Registries

Private registry configuration is managed via the [Admin dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx#registry-credentials) or via one of the CRDs installed by Okteto: `admin.okteto.com`. This last case is useful, for example, if you have your own mechanism to provision credentials/secrets in your cluster.

There are 3 types of registries you can configure: Static credentials, AWS IAM User and AWS IAM Role.

### Static credentials

To define your private registries with static credentials using CRDs, you have to create an [Opaque Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret) first with the data needed to access your private registry.
You will need to create a secret with the username and password to access to your registry.

Once the secret is created, you will need to create a resource with the apiVersion `admin.okteto.com/v1` and `Registry` kind, which is one of the CRDs installed by Okteto, referring to the secret which contains the credentials.

The name of this new resource should be the hostname of the registry (e.g. `index.docker.io`).
For example, if you want to add a configuration for Docker's registry, you will need to create a resource like this:

:::note
Defining the port through `spec.static.port` is optional and only available for static registries. It should only be used if the registry listens on a port other than the default http(s) 80/443
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  name: index.docker.io # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  static:
    port: 5000 # optional
    passwordSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the password
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the password is stored
    userSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the username
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the username is stored
```

### AWS IAM User

In the case of AWS IAM User, where you have to specify the Access Key and Access Secret, the process is similar to the static credentials one.
You will need to create a secret with those values, and then, create a CRD like this (the name of the resource has to be the hostname of the registry to be configured and it has to end with `.amazonaws.com`, e.g. `111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`):

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  name: 111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  awsIamUser:
    accessKeyIDSecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access key is stored
    secretAccessKeySecretRef:
      key: <field in referenced secret> # key of the secret which contains the access secret key
      name: <secret-name> # name of the secret where the access secret is stored
```

You can find more information [here](admin/registry-credentials/amazon-ecr.mdx#using-iam-user-credentials) about how to obtain the values to use.

### AWS IAM Role

In this case, the process is a bit simpler. It doesn't require a secret, as it doesn't store sensitive information. So, you will only need to
create a CRD like the following one specifying the registry hostname as the resource name (it has to end with `.amazonaws.com`, e.g. `111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`):

```yaml
apiVersion: admin.okteto.com/v1
kind: Registry
metadata:
  name: 111122223333.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com # hostname of the registry to be configured
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  awsIamRole:
    audience: okteto.example.com/us-east-2 # Audience used to exchange token to access the registry
    roleARN: arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/my-private-registry # ARN role with the permissions needed to access to the registry
```

You can find more information [here](admin/registry-credentials/amazon-ecr.mdx#using-iam-roles-via-openid-connect-oidc-federation) about how to obtain the values to use.

## Catalog Items

Catalog items are mainly managed via the [Admin dashboard](admin/dashboard.mdx#catalog), but can also be managed via one of the CRDs installed by Okteto: `catalogitems.git.okteto.com`. This last case is useful, for example, if you want to add catalog items manually with a simple `kubectl` command or manage your catalog using GitOps.
For example, if you want to add a configuration for a catalog item, you will need to create a resource like this:

- `metadata.name`: name of the CatalogItem resource to be created.
- `spec.branch`: default branch for the CatalogItem. (optional).
- `spec.manifestPath`: path to the manifest file in the repository. (optional).
- `spec.name`: name of the item that is displayed to the user in the UI Catalog list.
- `spec.repositoryUrl`: URL of the repository.  
- `spec.variables`: list of variables suggested to the user at deployment time. Each variable can be defined by name only, or by name and value. (optional).

```yaml title="my-catalog-item.yaml"
apiVersion: git.okteto.com/v1
kind: CatalogItem
metadata:
  name: my-catalog-item
  namespace: okteto
spec:
  branch: ""
  manifestPath: ""
  name: my-catalog-item
  repositoryUrl: https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
  variables:
    - name: VARIABLE_WITH_VALUE
      value: my-value
    - name: VARIABLE_WITHOUT_VALUE
```

To apply the changes in a manual sceario, you can simply run the command `kubectl apply -f my-catalog-item.yaml` from your terminal to add the catalog item to the your Catalog in the cluster.
