Preview environments allow you to include a live preview of your changes on every pull request. This is a fantastic way to collaborate with your team's technical, as well as non-technical members, to receive early feedback.

Okteto's preview environments are powered by Kubernetes and easily integrate with your favorite source control and CI/CD provider. They work using the [Okteto manifest](cloud/okteto-cli.mdx#okteto-manifest), so are very simple to get started with.
You can use Preview Environments with either [Okteto Cloud](index.md) or with [Okteto Self-Hosted](enterprise.mdx) if you want to run them on your Kubernetes infrastructure.

- [GitHub](cloud/preview-environments/github.mdx)
- [GitLab](cloud/preview-environments/gitlab.mdx)
- Circle CI (coming soon!)
- Bitbucket Pipelines (coming soon!)
- CodeFresh (coming soon!)

## Prerequisites

Preview environments deploy the code in a pull request to [Okteto](index.md). You can configure the way your code gets deployed using the [Okteto manifest](cloud/okteto-cli.mdx#okteto-manifest)'s `deploy` section.
