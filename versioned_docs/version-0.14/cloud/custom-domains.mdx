By default, an application deployed in Okteto Cloud will be available at its Okteto Cloud domain, which has the form `*-$NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net`.

For example, an application called `hello` deployed in the namespace `cindylopez` will be available at `https://hello-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net`.

To make your applications available on a non-Okteto Cloud domain (for example: `myapp.com`), you can add a **custom domain to your Okteto Cloud namespace**.

Applications that use custom domains will automatically get issued a valid certificate, just like regular Okteto Cloud endpoints.

> Okteto does not provide a domain registration service (for registering a custom domain name) or a DNS provider service.

## Add a Custom Domain Name to your Application.

Perform the following tasks to register your custom domain in your Okteto Cloud account:

1. Confirm that you own the custom domain name. Need a custom domain name? You can buy one with a domain registration service.

2. [Reach out to support](https://okteto.com/support) to register your custom domain with Okteto Cloud. Please include the domain, your github ID, and the namespace you want to use in your communications.

3. Update your DNS configuration so your custom domain points to Okteto Cloud's DNS target.

## Configure your Application to use your Custom Domain

Once your domain has been registered with your Okteto Cloud account, it's time to put it to use.

If you're using Okteto Cloud's [auto-ingress](cloud/ssl.mdx) or [generate the host](cloud/ssl.mdx#let-okteto-generate-the-host) features, then there's nothing to change. Just redeploy your application, and it will automatically pick up your custom domain.

For example, if your application's endpoint was `https://hello-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net` and you added the custom domain `myapp.com`, after redeployment your application's endpoint will be `https://hello.myapp.com`.

### Using your Root Domain

If you want to make your application available in the root domain you provided, you'll need to make a small change to your manifests.

If you're using Okteto Cloud's auto-ingress features, change the value of the `dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress` annotation in your service to the word `domain`, as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-service
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress: "domain"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: "hello-world"
    port: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-world
```

If you're creating your own ingress, change the value of the `dev.okteto.com/generate-host` annotation in your ingress to the word `domain`, as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-ingress
  annotations:
    dev.okteto.com/generate-host: "domain"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: hello-world
          servicePort: 8080
```

Okteto will automatically generate the correct host at deploy time. For example, if you added the custom domain `myapp.com` to your namespace, the ingress will be created with `myapp.com` as the host.

```console
$ kubectl get ingress custom-dns
```

```
NAME         HOSTS          ADDRESS                                                     PORTS     AGE
custom-dns   myapp.com      104.155.138.215,104.197.238.82,104.198.241.5,35.224.92.98   80, 443   169m
```

We recommend you use this approach instead of hard-coding the host name in your manifests to keep them portable across namespaces.

## Docker compose applications

If you deployment is powered by a docker compose manifest, add a label to the service you want to configure a custom domain as shown below:

```yaml
services:
  fastapi:
    build: .
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=postgres://pguser:pgpass@postgres:5432/pgdb
      - secret=dev
    labels:
      dev.okteto.com/auto-ingress: "true"
  postgresql:
    image: bitnami/postgresql:latest
    ports:
      - 5432
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=pguser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pgpass
      - POSTGRES_DB=pgdb
    volumes:
      - data:/bitnami/postgresql
volumes:
  data:

```


## Configure your DNS

In order to use your custom domain in Okteto, you'll need to point your custom DNS to `$NAMESPACE.cloud.okteto.net`.

You usually configure a `CNAME` record with your DNS provider to point to it. We recommend you add a wildcard entry so you don't need to create an entry for every service deployed:

| Record       | Name             | Target  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| `CNAME`        | `*.myapp.com`  | `cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net`  |
| `CNAME`        | `myapp.com`    | `cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net`  |

> Consult your DNS provider's documentation for specific instructions on creating CNAME records.

You can confirm your DNS is configured correctly with the `host` command, assuming your DNS changes have propagated:

```
$ host hello.myapp.com
```

```
hello.myapp.com is an alias for cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net.
cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net has address ...
```
