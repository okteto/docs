### Bugfixes
- Private CAs are now correctly propagated to the worker nodes.


## 0.14.0
July 14, 2022

### Features
- Add structured and staged logs for pipelines. Groups logs by stage in the okteto UI.
- Support adding custom environment variables for main Okteto components
- Support adding custom annotations, labels, and environment variables to the pipeline installer jobs
- Display the CLI version used by the pipeline installer jobs in the Okteto UI admin panel

### Improvements
- Upgraded Okteto CLI to [2.4.2](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases/tag/2.4.2)
