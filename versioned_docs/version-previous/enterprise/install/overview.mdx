Okteto Enterprise is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of [Okteto Cloud](/docs/previous/cloud/), with the control and flexibility of running in your own infrastructure.

Okteto Enterprise is free for small teams.  You get all the features of [Okteto Enterprise](/docs/previous/enterprise/) for up to 3 users with 3 namespaces each.

Want to use Okteto Enterprise with a bigger team? [Let's talk](https://okteto.com/#talktous) 😎.

### Upgrading

Instructions on how to upgrade your Okteto Enterprise instance [are available here](/docs/previous/enterprise/install/upgrade/).

Please review [the release notes before upgrading](/docs/previous/enterprise/install/releases/). New features, known issues, and configuration changes will be listed there.

### 3.5. Uninstalling Okteto Enterprise

To delete an existing release use:

```console
$ helm delete <your-release-name>
```

This will delete Okteto Enterprise, but not the resources created when using it (e.g. namespaces, accounts, deployments, etc...).
