This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Okteto Registry with Azure Storage Container to store your container images.

In this guide, `<<storage-account-access-key>>` refers to a storage account access key with read/write permissions to the storage container you want to use for the Okteto Registry.

Create a secret with the value of `<<storage-account-access-key>>` using the command below:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic okteto-registry-secret --namespace=okteto --from-literal=secretKey=<<storage-account-access-key>>
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Okteto Helm configuration file:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
registry:
  storage:
    provider:
      azure:
        enabled: true
        storage:
          container: <<your-storage-container-name>>
          accountName: <<your-service-account-name>>
```

Finally, [upgrade your Okteto instance](self-hosted/manage/upgrade.mdx) for the new configuration to be applied.
We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help you troubleshoot any issues.
