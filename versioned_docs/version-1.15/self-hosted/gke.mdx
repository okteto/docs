This guide will show you how to install Okteto onto Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). We'll be focusing exclusively on GKE in order to keep it as simple as possible.

## Requirements

In order to fully install Okteto, you will need the following:

- A subdomain to which you can add a wildcard DNS record
- A Kubernetes cluster
- A working installation of kubectl
- A working installation of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)
- An Okteto License

### Subdomain

You'll need sufficient access to a [subdomain](self-hosted/administration/configuration.mdx#subdomain) to add a wildcard DNS record, such as dev.example.com.
By default, all endpoints created by Okteto for your development environments will be exposed on the wildcard subdomain you choose.

This guide assumes your domain is registered in [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) service.
You can use any DNS service you prefer, but this guide focuses specifically on Google Cloud DNS.

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We recommend that you follow Google's [GKE cluster creation guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster).
Okteto supports Kubernetes versions 1.24 through 1.26.

We recommend the following specs:
- v1.26
- A pool with at least 3 `n2-standard-4` nodes
- 250 GB per disk

You'll be using the cluster's API server endpoint when configuring Okteto.
Run the following command to obtain your cluster's API server endpoint:

```
kubectl config view --minify | grep server
```

> Our installation guides assume Okteto will be running in a dedicated cluster. We recommend [contacting our team](https://www.okteto.com/contact/) if you plan on installing Okteto in a cluster with other workloads.

### Installing kubectl

Follow the official documentation for [installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Once installed, configure `kubectl` to [talk to your new cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry).

### Installing Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)

Follow the official documentation for [installing the latest release of Helm v3 (v3.8 or higher)](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Adding the Okteto Helm repository

You'll need to add the Okteto repository in order to be able to install Okteto:

```console
helm repo add okteto https://charts.okteto.com
helm repo update
```

### Getting your Okteto License

You'll receive a license key as part of your subscription to Okteto. If you haven't received it, [please open a support ticket](https://okteto.com/support).

## Installing Okteto

### Configuring your Okteto instance

Download a copy of the [Okteto GKE configuration file](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/gke/config.yaml), open it, and set the following values:

- Your `license`
- A `subdomain`
- Your cluster's API server endpoint

For example:

```yaml
license: 1234567890ABCD==
subdomain: dev.example.com

cluster:
  endpoint: https://35.205.100.149

buildkit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true

registry:
  storage:
    filesystem:
      persistence:
        enabled: true
```

### Installing your Okteto instance

Install the latest version of Okteto by running:

```console
helm install okteto okteto/okteto -f config.yaml --namespace=okteto --create-namespace
```

> You can also install a specific version by including the `--version` argument.

After a few seconds, all the resources will be created. The output will look something like this:

```
Release "okteto" has been installed. Happy Helming!
NAME: okteto
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 26 18:07:55 2020
NAMESPACE: okteto
STATUS: deployed
```

### Retrieve the Ingress Controller IP address

You can use `kubectl` to fetch the address that has been dynamically allocated by GKE to the NGINX Ingress we've just installed and configured as a part of Okteto:

```console
kubectl get service -l=app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --namespace=okteto
```

The output will look something like this:

```
NAME                              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                     AGE
okteto-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.7.73    34.68.230.234   80:30795/TCP,443:32481/TCP,1234:30885/TCP   5m
```

You'll need to take the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, and add it to your DNS for the domain you have chosen to use. In Google Cloud DNS, this is done by creating an `A` record with the name  `*`. We also suggest you set the TTL to 1 minute.

## Sign in to your Okteto instance

After a successful installation, you can access your Okteto instance at `https://okteto.SUBDOMAIN`. Your account will be automatically created as part of the login process. The first user to successfully login into the instance will be automatically assigned the `administrator` role.

> **Important**: The default installation is not recommended for production use. We highly advise following the steps outlined in the [Admin Dashboard](administration/dashboard.mdx#installation) before giving your team access to your Okteto instance.

The default installation is all that's required to follow our [getting started](getting-started.mdx) guide.
