The easiest way to get early feedback from your team is to share a preview environment that mimics your full-stack application.  

Preview environments allow you to spend time coding and testing, not standing in line for staging, or waiting for the DevOps team to create temporary environments. Having a production-like preview environment also means you can share your work with all members of your team for review, from both technical and non-technical roles. Loop everyone in, and avoid last minute change requests. 

Okteto preview environments can be created automatically with each pull request, and can be available as either personal or global environments (global requires administrator privileges).
