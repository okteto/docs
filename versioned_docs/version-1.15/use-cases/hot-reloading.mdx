Waiting for code to redeploy after making changes can waste a lot of your time. 

Thanks to Okteto’s hot reloading, you can see changes in your code as you make them. 
This speeds up the inner loop, which means new features can ship faster, 
and you won’t have to waste time waiting around just to preview one small change. 

When you save your code, Okteto will automatically synchronize your changes to your development container. 
Those changes are automatically detected and hot reloaded. No commit, build, or push required!
