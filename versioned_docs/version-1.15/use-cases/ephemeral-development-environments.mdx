We’ve all been there. You push code to production only to introduce a bug that proves difficult to find. But it worked on your machine, so what happened? 

Often when dealing with several micro dependencies, plus the complexity of Kubernetes, it can be hard to get a realistic picture of what code will actually do when it makes its way to production. You can always push code to staging, but there are even differences in how staging and production operate, and neither mimic the setup on your own machine. 

That’s where Okteto’s realistic dev environments can help. When you can stop relying on your own machine’s setup, and instead have a dev environment that mimics production (without needing to load a million things onto your laptop), you can rest assured that if it works in Okteto, it will work in production. Okteto works with MacOS, Windows, and Linux, and works with any cluster, whether remote or local.
