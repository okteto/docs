Testing is an integral part of software development. 
You can’t push code to production if you don’t know it works, and integration testing is key to making sure that 
components of your program work together. 

In integration testing, individual units of a program are tested as a group, 
and this type of testing is often carried out by a testing team, not the developers who wrote the code. 
Of course, this means that there is always the chance that something could break along the way, 
which is why having integration environments on demand to run end to end integration tests can be 
so valuable for teams. Okteto’s integration environments can be spun up easily for testing 
and are easily shared with others in your team for collaboration. When you run integration tests 
you’ll know that if it works in Okteto it will work in production.
