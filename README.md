# The Okteto Documentation

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9727b18a-8038-4a4e-91ff-95315bf76ead/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/okteto-docs/deploys)

This repository is the source for https://okteto.com/docs. If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please first check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on how to get started.

## Development

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Develop With Okteto

- [Install Okteto CLI](https://www.okteto.com/docs/getting-started/#installing-okteto-cli)
- [Set your `okteto context`](https://www.okteto.com/docs/getting-started/#configuring-okteto-cli-with-okteto-cloud)
- Clone the repo and run `okteto up` from the root of the repo

You should now see the docs deployed on http://localhost:8080/docs/ üöÄ

### üíª Develop locally

*You'll need to install `node` 16+ and `yarn` 1.22+ locally in order to be able to build the doc site locally.* 


Clone the repo and then run:

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

## Create a new version of the Docs

*A new version of the docs is created once the documentation for a certain version is "finished". This is typically done in preparation of a new release.*


### Create a new version
To create a new version, run the following commands:

```
yarn add docusaurus
yarn run docusaurus docs:version 1.XX
```

This will create a new version with the docs on your current branch. 

### Change the default version

*The default version of the docs is created and published once a new version of Okteto is available. This is typically done as part of the release process of Okteto Self-Hosted.*


Modify the `presets.docs.versions` section of  [`docusaurus.config.js`](docusaurus.config.js) as follows:


1. Update `lastVersion` to the new official version

2. Update `current` to the version in development

3. Update the values of the `path` of the  previous official version in the  `versions` subsection to match the version number. 

    Before
    ```
        '1.4': {
            label: '1.4',
            path: '/'
            banner: 'none',
        },
    ```

    After
    ```
        '1.4': {
            label: '1.4',
            path: '1.4'
            banner: 'none',
        },
    ```

4. Add a new entry in the `versions` subsection to match the new official version, with `/` as the path.
    
    ```
        '1.5': {
            label: '1.5',
            path: '/'
            banner: 'none',
        },
    ```


Modify the redirection rules on `netlify.toml` so that `/docs/$OFFICIAL_VERSION/` redirects to `/docs`

```
# Redirect the current version to /docs/
[[redirects]]
  from = "/docs/1.5/*"
  to = "/docs/:splat"
  status = 301
```

https://github.com/okteto/docs/pull/314 is a good example of how to set up the files


## Components

### Product tiers list

Sometimes, documentation is specific to a product tier. You can add a badge beside headings using the [TiersList](https://github.com/okteto/docs/blob/main/src/theme/TiersList/index.js) component.

##### Usage

Tiers is a `string` of tier separated by a space

```md
# Page heading<TiersList tiers="Scale Self-Hosted" />
```
